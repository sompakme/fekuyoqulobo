The ones that pull this off are able to go down as legends of the business. A great example of this is <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>, who has been a star for over two decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Spears is still making money from her biggest records</a>, and <a href=#>the recent ending of her conservatorship</a> means that she can enter a new phase of her career.</p><p>Spears' lengthy stay in Hollywood has included many elements, including a short-lived reality show from the 2000s. Let's take a closer look at this forgotten show.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-britney-spears-39-reality-show>What Happened To Britney Spears' Reality Show?</h2><p>During the latter part of the 1990s, Britney Spears came from seemingly out of nowhere to become the face of pop music. The star had been cutting her teeth for years, and once she hit the global stage, she completely conquered the world of pop culture and never looked back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The height of Spears' career was filled with and an endless amount of hit songs, an unfathomable amount of media attention, and a whole lot of money coming her way. Simply put, the star as a powerhouse that no one was coming close to matching.</p><p>After selling an estimated 100 million records around the world, Britney Spears has nothing left to accomplish in music. Despite this, fans would love nothing more than for the singer to drop a new album and venture out on a global trek.</p><p>Spears has done a bit of everything during her iconic career, even starring on a short-lived reality show that people have forgotten about.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Gives Fans A Peek At Her Wedding Veil Ahead Of Nuptials To Sam Asghari</a></span></p><h2 id=she-had-a-reality-show-called-39-chaotic-39>She Had A Reality Show Called 'Chaotic'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2005, Britney Spears completely shocked the world when she decided to star on her own reality show. Yes, plenty of celebrities had their own reality shows during the 2000s, but no one expected Britney Spears, a legitimate A-list star, to go this route.</p><p>Dubbed Britney & Kevin: Chaotic, the show was just that: chaotic. It highlighted Spears' time with Kevin Federline, and it gave people a personal glimpse into their lives away from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood.</p><p>As EW noted, the singer had a tendency to get way too candid on the show.</p><p>"It’s one thing for Britney to put her <a href=#>personal life on wax</a>; it’s another for her to put it on tape. In the first episode, titled “Can You Handle My Truth,” Spears is in a not-so flattering position as she faces her “Britney Cam” and talks about how she doesn’t want an ugly guy, but the camera’s all in her nasal passage and undone hair extensions. Whoa, zoom out a bit, Brit," the site wrote.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show did the singer no favors in the court of public opinion, and people were frankly shocked at what they saw on screen. It functioned largely as a vlog before that was even a thing, Vice noted, and Spears' open talk of sex, filming of a naked Federline, and sheer candidness caught people by surprise.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Has Some Pretty Surprising Pregnancy Symptoms</a></span></p><h2 id=39-chaotic-39-didn-39-t-last-long>'Chaotic' Didn't Last Long</h2><p>Unfortunately, this show was not able to stick around for the long haul. During its brief stint on UPN, it managed to lose a huge chunk of its audience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Blurred</a>, "Britney Spears’ fans seemed to have abandoned her: The relatively small number of people that tuned in to watch the first episode of her UPN reality series didn’t tune in for the finale. More than a million and a half jumped ship over Britney and Kevin: Chaotic‘s five-week run. As Access Hollywood reported, for the premiere, “On May 17, the show drew 3.7 million viewers, however, that fell to 3 million the next week and again to 2.5 million for the May 31 and June 7 shows. The finale drew 2.1 million viewers.” That’s a drop of 1.6 million viewers in just over a month."</p><p>Needless to say, this is not what anyone involved with the project was expecting. In due time, the show was completely done away with, and for the most part, it has been completely forgotten about.</p><p>Spears, of course, has not forgotten about it, and she has gone on record saying that it was the wrong move to make.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer eventually revealed, "I would never do something like that again. Actually, that was really bad. That was probably the worst thing I’ve done in my career.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Britney Spears Says Ex Kevin Federline Refused To See Her While Pregnant</a></span></p><p>Britney & Kevin: Chaotic is an odd piece of TV history, and it's one that most people won't even bother watching.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Pregnant Britney Spears Admits She's 'Scared' To Welcome A Child Into This World</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq7RoqunnaliwLGxwKuqZqqVlrmqwNhmqqGnp2Kwqa3OraCcZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
