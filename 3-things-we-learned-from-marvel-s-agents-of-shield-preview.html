The 30-second clip, an early look inside the high tech espionage and global law-enforcement agency in charge with keeping the Marvel universe in check, makes one thing clear. Fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who appeared in the 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, as well as Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and Thor, is back from the dead (!!!). With head creative consultant Joss Whedon and studio president Kevin Feige leading the way, Marvel is on a monumental, money-printing roll (Iron Man <a href=# id=auto-tag_3_3 data-tag=3>3</a> has already pulled in close to a billion dollars worldwide). While everyone is still speculating on whether or not lead spy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) will make an appearance, there’s more to dissect when it comes to the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. preview. Read on, true believers.—Keith Murphy (murphdogg29) <span id=more-155005></span></p><p><strong>1. S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents Seem To Have the Goods</strong></p><p>On their early promo shot, the Coulson-led crew looked about as intimidating as a preview of the newly re-launched cast of ‘All My Children.’ But the TV trailer tells a way cooler, more hardcore tale. Weapons man Agent Leo Fitz is seen handling some pretty bout-it gadgets. Combat expert and former soldier Ming-Na is kicking some poor soul’s ass. And a shook Skye (not an agent) looks like she’s just seen the Hulk. Let’s hope we also get some S.H.I.E.L.D. originals like Dum Dum Dugan, Gabriel “Gabe” Jones and Sharon Carter, as well as the gorgeous Maria Hill (played by Cobie Smulders in the Avengers flick) in the mix.</p><p><strong>2. Luke Cage Or Rage…You Decide</strong></p><p>That mysterious super powered man jumping out of the window and saving some lucky ladies’ hide was initially tagged as Luke Cage, A.K.A. Power Man. But it’s looking more and more like we may have another heroic brother on our hands. All signs point to former Avengers and New Warriors member Rage.<br>It was UGO editor-in-chief Chris Radtke that caught the clue on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter </a>by pointing out the Marvel animated bumper shows a quick glimpse of the inhumanly powerful character who gets stronger and stronger the more he is hit. That said, Marvel still needs to get started on a ‘70s inspired Heroes for Hire series featuring Power Man, Iron Fist and the rest of the gang. Sweet Christmas!</p><p><strong>3. Coulson Is Still A Badass</strong></p><p>When you’ve survived getting bodied by an Asgardian God, you can pretty much do whatever the hell you want. That includes naming your vintage Corvette Lola. Of course there’s more to the whip than meets the eye. Does it soar to the skies at 50,000 feet? Was it designed by Starks Industries (It was Tony’s genius team of scientists and builders that created the original S.H.I.E.L.D. Flying Car Mark V)? What about those guided missiles, 20 mm electric cannon, and underwater capabilities? And what of that mysterious figure inside the fiery image in which Coulson is walking towards? Could be a villain, hero or a hologram showing some super powered crime scene. Whatever it is, we want more, we want more (cue adorable AT&T girl).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2h6tbTIp56sZaeaeq2xwKulnpxdoq6zwsSlqmaZl5q7tb%2BMrJ%2BinZyZerG%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZoJ2fI9uZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
