That's despite the bizarre claim of LeBlanc's father that his son thought Perry was an "a**hole" and that he wanted to "pound on him a couple of times."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering how they've worked closely together on the hit sitcom for a decade, we're sure that even if those claims were true, those feelings eventually faded as the show went on. The show's reunion was good evidence of that and many other things about&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Friends&nbsp;cast's impenetrable bond</a>. But there's something the show didn't reveal about LeBlanc and Perry. After all these years, it's interesting to know which of the two Matts actually&nbsp;have a higher net worth in 2021. Lucky for you, we have&nbsp;the answer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="‘Friends’ Reunion: Matt LeBlanc Takes Unexpected Side In Ross And Rachel Break Drama" href=#>‘Friends’ Reunion: Matt LeBlanc Takes Unexpected Side In Ross And Rachel Break Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-did-matt-leblanc-and-matthew-perry-make-in-friends>How Much Did Matt LeBlanc And Matthew Perry Make In 'Friends'?</h2><p>By the ninth season of&nbsp;Friends, the cast was reportedly making $1 million each per episode. Until now, they also earn $20 million between them in royalties per year. That's their 2 percent cut from the show's annual syndication rights earnings amounting to $1 billion. During the reunion, each of the six lead actors also earned at least $2.5 million. That's pretty huge for a day spent revisiting their former set and hanging out with friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among the&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;cast, Jennifer Aniston makes the most money. Although she made the same amount as the rest of the cast during the show, she went on to score more projects in Hollywood following the series. Her box office triumphs have made her gain&nbsp;a total estimated net worth of $300 million. Currently, she also stars in the series&nbsp;The Morning Show&nbsp;with Reese Witherspoon where she makes $2 million per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="‘Friends’: Matthew Perry Said The Most Chandler Thing Ever While Filming The Fountain Scene" href=#>‘Friends’: Matthew Perry Said The Most Chandler Thing Ever While Filming The Fountain Scene</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, LeBlanc and Perry didn't get the same break as Aniston did. They kept working after the series, but they surely didn't attain the level at which the Along Came Polly actress continues to work. The Friends duo has also taken very different paths following their roles as Joey and Chandler.</p><h2 id=matt-leblanc-s-net-worth-as-of-2021>Matt LeBlanc's Net Worth As Of 2021</h2><p>After Friends,&nbsp;Matt LeBlanc went on to have his own show&nbsp;Joey, a&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;spin-off that only lasted two seasons. The now 53-year-old actor has also appeared in just a few movies following the 10-season hit series. All of them were minor roles, too. For 10 years after his spin-off's failure, he didn't get any project that put him back in the spotlight. Apparently, being the most good-looking friend didn't do much for his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, LeBlanc graced television again when he landed the lead role in&nbsp;Man with a Plan. It ran for four seasons where he made $200,000 per episode. Definitely a huge drop from his&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;salary where he was already making a whopping $750,000 an episode by its seventh and eighth seasons. The actor also had a hosting gig in&nbsp;Top Gear&nbsp;for seasons where he made a total of $2 million — still a very low amount compared to his&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;earnings. To sum it all up, Matt LeBlanc has an estimated net worth of $80 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Twitter Fans Keep Comparing ‘Friends’ Star Matt Leblanc To Their Irish Uncles And It’s The Funniest Thing Ever" href=#>Twitter Fans Keep Comparing ‘Friends’ Star Matt Leblanc To Their Irish Uncles And It’s The Funniest Thing Ever</a></span></p><h2 id=mattew-perry-s-net-worth-as-of-2021>Mattew Perry's Net Worth As Of 2021</h2><p>Matthew Perry is actually the third-highest earner among the six&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;following second placer Courtney Cox who has an estimated net worth of $150 million. That's just half of what top placer Jennifer Aniston is worth. Despite not starring in his own TV series like LeBlanc, Perry has his own non-acting strategies for making money. Of course, unlike his onscreen bestie, the now 51-year-old actor still ended up starring in major movie roles. Then again, they weren't box office hits like Aniston's string of films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Perry focused on investing after&nbsp;Friends ended. Just like his character Chandler, he's indeed a big saver. He has property investments including a penthouse in Hollywood which sold for about $15 million. The actor has an impressive net worth of $120 million despite his well-documented issues with substance abuse. Perry has always been open about his battle with addiction. Once he revealed that because of that, he doesn't remember much of his role in&nbsp;Friends between its third and sixth seasons.</p><p>But hey, he's still worth more than Matt LeBlanc. It goes to show that Matthew Perry has turned his life around in the last years to make sure his hard-earned&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;wealth doesn't go to waste.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Fans Don't Believe Matthew Perry's Dental Work Is The Reason For His Demeanor" href=#>Fans Don't Believe Matthew Perry's Dental Work Is The Reason For His Demeanor</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYrmmrsuapZxlpqh6rq3TrZ%2Ber12lsrO%2B2GauoaGTnXqnvsiepZ2rXajBor6MoZisZZFitaqzx56pZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2ahnmJ%2FcX6QaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
