The reggae legend was in his prime and became Jamaica's beloved ambassador. He even received a crowded state funeral, where approximately 100,000 people honored the music icon, according to Stylecaster. While Marley was at the top of his game in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was dealing with a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">deeply personal health challenge</a>. Since July 1977,<strong> Marley had been battling cancer</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Toots-feature.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Toots Hibbert, Father of Reggae Music, Dies at 77">Toots Hibbert, Father of Reggae Music, Dies at 77</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>The first time Hibbert used the term "reggae" was when he performed Do the Reggay with his band, the Maytals.</p><p>Marley was originally diagnosed with skin cancer on his toe, commonly thought to have been caused by a soccer accident. While he did injure himself during a game, Marley already had cancer and was not aware. The injury led to his eventual diagnosis, according to ati. After a biopsy confirmed Marley's cancer, the entertainer's doctor<strong> </strong>strongly advised a toe amputation to treat the cancer before it became more severe and life-threatening.</p><p>Marley, a devout Rastafarian, declined such an operation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>This life-saving surgery went against his religious beliefs</strong></li><li><strong>Marley's cancer was treated with less effective methods</strong></li><li><strong>These treatment options had unfortunate consequences</strong></li></ul><p>While Marley eventually agreed to have a skin graft on his toe to help remove the cancer, it was not enough.

While Marley tried experimental treatments that were aligned with his Rastafarian beliefs in Germany, they proved to have no success. Marley eventually chose to return to Jamaica to live out his final days. Unfortunately, he never made it home. After Marley's health took a turn for the worse, he was brought to a hospital in Miami, Florida on his journey back to Jamaica. He succumbed to his illness on May 11th, 1981, nearly four years after<strong> </strong>he was first diagnosed.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Bob-Marley.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Bob Marley's Son, Damian Marley Follows In His Musical Footsteps ">Bob Marley's Son, Damian Marley Follows In His Musical Footsteps</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Bob Marley was the father to many children, including Damian Marley, who became successful in his musical career and personal life.</p><p>After his state funeral, Marley was laid to rest in a private mausoleum near his childhood home in Nine Mile, Jamaica.

"At the moment when the gunmans broke in, we were rehearsing 'I Shot The Sheriff.' Bob had stepped out, 'cause the horns weren't on that record and the horn players wanted to play it...He came out of the rehearsal room and went into the kitchen to get a grapefruit or something...And all of a sudden you see a hand come through the door like, around the door, and start firing this .38."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Koffee.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="12 Reggae/Dancehall Artists To Watch Out For">12 Reggae/Dancehall Artists To Watch Out For</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>A new cohort of young reggae and dancehall artists are bringing their music back to the mainstream.</p><p>Marley was able to recover from his injuries and performed the concert he had planned, only two days after the attack.
