In September 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox announced</a> that the role would be played by actor James Oliver Cromwell&nbsp;(Easy Street, Six Feet Under).</p><h2 id=flaws-in-the-character>Flaws In The Character</h2><p>Before all this,&nbsp;Kiefer had asked his father Donald Sutherland to join him in the cast of 24 and play the said bad guy in Season 6. Sutherland senior&nbsp;however refused to portray Phillip, because of&nbsp;certain flaws that he found in the character.</p><p>Phillip Bauer first appeared in the series shortly into the sixth season. At that point, he was&nbsp;trying to cover up the fact that he had been involved in a plot to help terrorists acquire Russian-made nuclear suitcase&nbsp;bombs.&nbsp;The terrorists intended to deploy these on US soil.</p><p>At first, he managed to convince his son Jack - working for the federal agency, Counter Terrorism Unit (CTU) - that he was only doing it to protect the family business and Jack's brother Graem from indicted on&nbsp;treason charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joss Whedon Had This To Say About Donald Sutherland</a></span></p><p>It eventually turned out that the conspiracy ran much deeper than that, and that Phillip's motivation&nbsp;had only been the preservation of his own legacy. In the course of&nbsp;his self-serving quest, he ended up killing Graem, threatened to kill his grandson, Josh, and came very close to killing Jack himself.</p><p>This type of character was not in the least appealing to Donald Sutherland. In an old engagement with a reporter, he said, "I told Kiefer, 'I'd love to play Sean Connery to your Harrison Ford (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indiana Jones</a> and the Last Crusade), but not a father who wants to kill you.' We're looking for something else we can do together."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Donald-Sutherland-with-son-Kiefer.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=no-humanizing-traits>No Humanizing Traits</h2><p>Cromwell was himself critical of the writing of his character, as he did not see any humanizing traits that would have made him connect with&nbsp;Phillip Bauer and his motives better.</p><p>"I had never seen the show before, and I took it because my agent said it was important to do, that it would be a good thing. They paid me a lot of money to do it," he said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview</a> after he had exited the show. "And then I’ve taken my son captive and I’m torturing him, then I was going to take my grandson captive and threaten him. So I went to the producers and I said, “Look, are there any redeeming qualities to this character?” They looked at me as though I was nuts, I was asking something bizarre."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Actors Who Hated The Television Roles That Made Them Famous</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Donald made the comment&nbsp;about his desire&nbsp;to work on a project with his son&nbsp;in 2008.&nbsp; Nearly seven years later, the Sutherland father-and-son duo finally got to live their dream. They came together to&nbsp;create&nbsp;the Western film,&nbsp;Forsaken, where they indeed played a father and his estranged son.</p><p>Kiefer was&nbsp;elated at the outcome&nbsp;and shortly before the movie release, he was quoted saying, "I’ve wanted to work with my father for 30 years, and I’m really grateful that I finally had the opportunity. And it ended up—the experience and, I believe, the film—better than I could ever have hoped for."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Sweetest Celebrity Mother-Daughter Relationships</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbyvrcudZKytpJ2ys7jAp5tmqpWbwrSxw2arqGWjqa6zecClpqefo56xpnnHoqpmq5%2Bjeqy1xJ%2Bcq2WZo3pzgI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
