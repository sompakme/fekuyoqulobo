Sure, these days, the actor has a tremendous TV resume, however, when starting on the sitcom, he was completely naive about the entire experience, despite the fact that the show was a huge juggernaut.</p><p>Alongside Now To Love, <a href=#>the actor discussed his experience on the show.</a></p><p>"This was kind of at the beginning of all of my professional experience as an actor, so there was pressure, there was just pressure in general [laughs]. I remember being made aware that after I got that job, that I had landed somewhere of note."</p><p>"I was a little bit naive, I don't think I really knew what it all meant. I don't think I even really knew what big television actually meant in the kind of broader world, but the pressure was very real."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>This Iconic 'Friends' Guest Star Absolutely Hated The Cast, Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did he get the gig that changed his career but as it turns out, just being able to audition for the show was a task in itself. He had serious competition and in addition, funds for a ticket were extremely low.</p><h2 id=eddie-cahill-spent-his-last-230-in-the-bank-for-his-travel-to-audition-for-39-friends-39>Eddie Cahill Spent His Last $230 In The Bank For His Travel To Audition For 'Friends'</h2><p>It was his first audition and <a href=#>he spent his final $230 on a plane ticket.</a> Looking back, Eddie admitted himself, the experience was all well worth it. Alongside Media Village, the actor detailed his experience, making mention that after his audition, he was ready to fly back to New York.</p><p>Once he made his way outside of the studio, he looked completely lost and that's when Courteney Cox offered to help.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was supposed to go back to New York that day,” Cahill laughed. “We finish rehearsals and I was outside of Stage 24 and Courteney Cox looked at me. I must've looked lost. She said, ‘Do you need a ride home?’ I was way too scared to say, ‘Yes.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans Think This Was The Best 'Friends' Celebrity Cameo</a></span></p><p>The audition process was a tough one. He was paired alongside the talented fellow that played Clark Kent in 'Smallville', none other than Tom Welling.</p><p>“The final audition was on a Tuesday and down to myself and Tom Welling (Clark Kent on Smallville),” he recalled. “They bought us to set and whoever got the role was going to go to right to rehearsals. I remember walking into a room with Marta Kaufman, David Crane, Kevin Bright, and Jennifer Aniston and they could see I was terrified.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the nervousness, Cahill got the role. It was before the cell phone era, so he had asked for a phone in order to call his mom after the audition! What a story.</p><h2 id=eddie-cahill-had-a-great-relationship-with-the-cast-especially-david-schwimmer>Eddie Cahill Had A Great Relationship With The Cast, Especially David Schwimmer</h2><p>Working on a new show, with a cast that already developed chemistry and friendship can be that much harder. However, in Cahill's case, the transition was a very easy one to navigate, in large part thanks to David Schwimmer. Cahill recalls David making himself available from the start.</p><p>"David [Schwimmer], I think stands out in that respect. I got a phone call from him and he just kind of made himself available. You know, he said, 'Listen, I know you're new in town and you don't know anybody, I'm headed out and going to this place, you want to come with me?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"So he took me out and, and I mean, in a sense, took me under his wing. But they all offered me kindness and a sense that I belong."</p><p>Cahill spoke highly about the rest of the cast, including Jen Aniston, who played a major role in making him have a voice during his stint on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>This Former A-List Actor Was A Nightmare On The Set Of 'Friends'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicnZyZmnqkrceio6VlpJa0brbEp6WinpWneqK6yKyrqKZdm7%2Bqsc2dqmaZpZm2tbXOp2Sbqp%2Bgsm68zqipZrGfqruoew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
