“For the dusty crusty funky bi**hes in the bacccckkkk Beyoncé is the queen of rap (when she raps) and ALL other genres of music,” she wrote in her Instagram story on Thursday (Dec. 28). “Now stay mad [goofies] I said what I said and NANN bi**h gone check me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Carry on.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Miami rapper technically tripled down as she made a post on her Instagram feed to elaborate even further on her claim. “Now that I have y’all undivided attention ‼️ I am actually late to the party bcuz I wasn’t aware of this nonsense happening today bcuz Im too busy minding my business,” she wrote. “Let me just make myself CLEAR once again, since it’s a slow day for the blogs and bullsh*t, this interview was back in October at The One Music Festival.. I rlly don’t give a rats a** how anybody feel, I said what I said .. that’s the Queen Bey and I’m gonna STAN on that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Beyonce is the Queen of rap (when she raps) and ALL genres of music when it comes to me ‼️ go argue with the IRS or somebody else idc,” Trina continued in her post. “And that’s not up for debate over here. So run along and enjoy the rest of y’all day. (And make sure to clean behind y’all sofas before the New Year).”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This all came about after <a rel=nofollow href=#>HipHopDX</a> shared a clip from her interview at <a href=#>One MusicFest</a> in Atlanta earlier this week. While the “Here We Go” rapper shouted out the entire female rapper landscape and credited <a href=#>Salt-N-Pepa</a> as her earliest influence in the October interview, the focus quickly became what she said about the <a href=#>Renaissance</a> artist.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yeah, Beyoncé. Because she is the No. 1 female rapper when she does rap. There’s no sleeping on the Queen,” she said when asked what she believes opened the door for female rap to flourish the way it currently is. “It’s just one of those things, of course, it’s the Queen Beyoncé, but when you hearing a song and it’s rapping involved it’s like, oh my God — it’s more inspiration.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The funny part about that Trina interview is not the Beyoncé opening doors comment it’s the fact that Trina has been in the game for 20+ years and couldn’t even say her own name <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/YRhE9sWa0k</a></p>— papa ?
