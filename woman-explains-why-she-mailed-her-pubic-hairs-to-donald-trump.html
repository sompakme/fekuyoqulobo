Cheers, Emily.”&nbsp;</p><p>The mom of Zoey, 10, and Maddie, 6, then posted a photo of her contribution on Facebook on Saturday, October 8, with the caption, “Yes I did. #protest.”</p><p>Her post has received more than 2,000 likes and 514 shares. “You’re my spirit animal,” wrote one person, while another commented, “speechless in such a good way.”</p><p>“Donald Trump is a disgusting pig of a person and represents everything that females hate about existing in life as a woman,” Robinson tells <i>Us Weekly.</i> “I felt better after I mailed the letter. I felt relieved.”&nbsp;</p><p>As for people who are disgusted by Robinson’s act of protest? “If sexual assault doesn’t offend them but they think my pubes are disgusting, then they really need to rethink what is gross in this world,” she tells <i>Us.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Trump defended his comments as “locker room talk” when the story first broke Friday, October 7, then said in a video statement he shared via Twitter later that day that his lewd comments from 2005 are not representative of who he is as person. “I’ve never said that I’m a perfect person nor pretended to be someone that I’m not,” the 70-year-old Republican presidential candidate stated. “I’ve said and done things that I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The business mogul again defended his statements at the second presidential debate on Sunday, October 9. When pressed by moderator Anderson Cooper of CNN, the presidential hopeful denied that he had ever sexually assaulted women.&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawp52Wu26x16mjmqGeqHq4tNhmqqGdXaKuqrjEnWShnaJivbauyJxkoZmZp8BuwM5mm6imkaGxbsDRrqSpZadpgXWElXFm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
