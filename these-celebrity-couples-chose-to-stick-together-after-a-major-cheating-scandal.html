The two stuck together until February 2019, when they decided to go their separate ways for seemingly unrelated reasons.</p><p>"Trolls working hard today,” the rapper wrote on Instagram at the time. “I don’t be on a balcony with no thots. That s–t lame, Try again u trollsssss. Me and my wifey sturdy. Back to celebrating [sic]!!!”</p><p>They remained friendly and co-parented extremely well throughout their split. The two celebrities continued to support each other at events and showed a united front as a family.
