Her career spans over a decade, but with the new leg of the Eras Tour, she’s doing better than ever. Just this past weekend, Taylor was the biggest winner at the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards with nine wins, including Artist of the Year, Best Pop, Song of the Year, and Video of the Year. But, instead of her incredible accomplishments, fans are caught up in her most recent feud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Taylor Swift has been involved in many feuds. The list of <a href=# rel=nofollow>celebrities Taylor has beefed with</a> is long, but no one can forget her long-drawn <a href=# rel=nofollow>feud with Katy Perry</a> over some backup dancers. And most recently, the <a href=# rel=nofollow>‘All to Well’ singer threw shade at Kanye West</a> during a live performance, proving she’s still not over their 2009 feud.</p><p>Now, Taylor is rumored to be feuding with former Disney star Olivia Rodrigo. But do they really hate each other, or are fans reading too much into their interactions?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Taylor Swift Is Adding To Her Current $740 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-olivia-rodrigo-were-good-friends-until-taylor-accused-the-lsquo-driver-rsquo-s-license-rsquo-singer-of-copyright-infringement>Taylor Swift And Olivia Rodrigo Were Good Friends Until Taylor Accused The ‘Driver’s License’ Singer Of Copyright Infringement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screen-Shot-2021-06-14-at-4.11.31-PM.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Olivia Rodrigo and Taylor Swift’s friendship</a> began through social media interactions in 2020, shortly after gaining recognition for her work in High School Musical: The Musical: The Series. Rodrigo began by posting a video of her covering Swift’s song ‘Cruel Summer,’ to which Swift reacted by posting a cover of one of the young singer’s songs to her Instagram Stories.</p><p>From the start of her career, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Rodrigo openly admitted to being “the world’s biggest Swiftie.”</a> In an interview with Nylon, the young star gushed over Taylor, sharing a memory of how much she loved belting out the chorus of Swift’s ‘Picture to Burn’ when she was just four years old. Her admiration for the ‘Lover’ singer only grew more when they finally <a href=# rel=nofollow>met at the 2021 BRIT Awards</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift Gifts Olivia Rodrigo With an Extremely Sweet Personal Item</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, things took a turn for the worse when Olivia released her debut album "Sour" in 2021. As it turns out, Swift’s longtime writing partner and <a href=# rel=nofollow>friend Jack Antonoff</a> collaborated on one of Olivia's new tracks. "We interpolated ‘New Year’s Day,’ which is Taylor’s song from 'Reputation.' I came up with the '1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back’ concept, and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus," Olivia admitted, explaining why both songs sounded so similar.</p><p>Both Swift and Antonoff were credited for Rodrigo’s song ‘1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back,’ but the creative duo believed they also deserved recognition for the song ‘Deja Vu’ as it sounded eerily familiar to Taylor’s ‘Cruel Summer.’ Rumor has it that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taylor sued Olivia for copyright infringement</a> over this, although it’s never been confirmed. Ultimately, Rodrigo credited Taylor for ‘Deja Vu’ and had to pay millions of dollars in royalties to the singer, which seemed to put a strain on their friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-think-this-olivia-rodrigo-song-is-about-taylor-swift>Fans Think This Olivia Rodrigo Song Is About Taylor Swift</h2><p>Earlier this year, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Olivia Rodrigo released her new single ‘Vampire.’</a> The song quickly became a huge hit, with fans speculating what the song was about. Originally many believed it was about her <a href=# rel=nofollow>ex-boyfriend Adam Faze</a>. But then, fans began to speculate that the chorus line, “Bloodsucker, fame f*****, bleedin’ me dry like a goddamn vampire,” was actually about Taylor Swift and her rumored copyright infringement lawsuit against Rodrigo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Olivia was directly asked whether ‘Vampire’ was about Taylor</a>, to which she told Rolling Stone: “I mean, I never want to say who any of my songs are about. I’ve never done that before in my career and probably won’t. I think it’s better to not pigeonhole a song to being about this one thing.” Fans thought this vague answer was proof enough that the song was, in fact, calling out Taylor.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Controversial Fan Theory On Taylor Swift’s "Unearned" Popularity</a></span></p><p>To add more fuel to the fire, around this time, Taylor announced Sabrina Carpenter was going to join her Eras Tour lineup. Given that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Sabrina and Olivia had previously starred in a dramatic feud</a> over HSMTMTS star Joshua Basset, people took this as a sign that Taylor wasn’t too fond of Olivia anymore. It didn’t help that Olivia admitted she wouldn’t be attending Taylor’s Eras Tour when the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> asked her about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olivia-rodrigo-finally-opened-up-about-her-rumored-feud-with-taylor-swift>Olivia Rodrigo Finally Opened Up About Her Rumored Feud With Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/olivia-rodrigo-has-embarrassing-malfunction-at-vmas-after-her-second-album-debuts-to-controversy.jpg><p>Although Taylor Swift and Olivia Rodrigo’s rumored feud has been going on for several years now, neither one of the singers has addressed it. That is until <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Olivia finally shut down any rumors of a feud between her and Taylor</a>.</p><p>I don’t have beef with anyone,” the ‘Sour’ singer told Rolling Stone. “I’m very chill. I keep to myself. I have my four friends and my mom, and that’s really the only people I talk to, ever. There’s nothing to say. There’s so many Twitter conspiracy theories. I only look at alien conspiracy theories.”</p><p>To this day, Taylor has yet to say anything about this rumored feud.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5uvs6dqaKfn2LAsLrGZq2apaCev6Z5yKxkmmWjnby1ecCtZK2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
