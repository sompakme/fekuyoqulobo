At the same time, the actress is having the time of her life after turning 40.</p><h2 id=the-actress-dealt-with-controversy-in-her-early-years>The Actress Dealt With Controversy In Her Early Years</h2><p>Over the years, Miller had been through a lot. Sure, she was a rising star after landing roles in the 2004 films Layer Cake with Daniel Craig and Alfie with Jude Law. But soon after, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miller became the subject of public fascination and scrutiny</a> after she became engaged to Law.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I obviously have a lot of experience of kind of becoming well-known at a time when the tabloids really had all the power and the individual had very little. Anybody could really write anything,” the actress explained. “It was a real frenzy. A fever pitch of craziness.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did Sienna Miller's Heartbeat End Up In The 'Anatomy Of A Scandal' Soundtrack?</a></span></p><p>That craziness also doubled once it was revealed that Law cheated on Miller with his nanny just after their engagement. In the aftermath, <a href=#>the actress said she was forced to deal with a “very public heartbreak.”</a></p><p>Around that time, Miller chose to keep going, starring in films such as Factory Girl, Interview, Stardust, and G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra. But the movies only had modest success.</p><h2 id=and-her-thirties-were-lsquo-hard-rsquo>And Her Thirties Were ‘Hard’</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A few years later, it seemed like Miller’s star was on the rise again. The actress memorably portrayed actress Tippi Hedren in The Girl, earning her both Golden Globe and BAFTA nods. At the same time, Miller also found love again, this time getting engaged to actor Tom Sturridge.</p><p>They would go on to have a daughter, Marlowe. However, the couple would also call it quits after four years (they are now happy co-parents). After that, Miller also dated and got engaged to Lucas Zwirner, the son of famous art dealer David Zwirner.</p><p>Unfortunately, their romance was also short-lived. “I was never somebody who dreamt of getting married. I’ve been engaged a few times, but I’ve never been married,” Miller said. “It’s better than three divorces, I think.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Sienna Miller Really Feels About Her Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looking back, the actress knows that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her 30s weren’t how she imagined them to be</a>. “My thirties were hard,” Miller remarked. “Really hard.” She dreamt of settling down and growing her family, but life had other plans. “There was a lot of anxiety,” the actress continued.</p><p>“Relationships hadn’t worked out – I imagined that I would be married with three kids, being a great mum. I love being a mother.”</p><p>Miller also has some regrets about that period in her life. “I’d invested what felt like the important years in something that was just a bucket with a hole in it of a person,” she explained. “I wasted time. And I felt like time was really my currency.”</p><p>But now that’s Miller just a little bit older, she can see more clearly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sienna-miller-on-turning-40-lsquo-it-was-like-coming-out-of-a-clearing-rsquo>Sienna Miller On Turning 40: ‘It Was Like Coming Out Of A Clearing’</h2><p>For the actress, turning 40 was an extra special milestone. These days, Miller also feels like she has a lot more clarity. “When I got to 40, it was like coming out of a clearing,” she said. “I felt so excited.”</p><p>Not only that but the actress isn’t bothered by tabloids anymore.</p><p>“As a young woman I was so trivialised and so insubstantial-seeming, but there’s very little that anyone can say to a 40-year-old woman, Miller continued. “And I also don’t give a f***. It was such a headline in my life – what people thought of me. It was so loud that I believed it. Now I’ve got to a point where it’s absolutely none of your business.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jude Law Once Cheated On Sienna Miller And Turned Her Career Upside Down. Does She Still Resent Him Now?</a></span></p><p>These days, she is also just ready to live her life. “I will do my job,” Miller said. “I will be a pleasure to work with. I will raise my girl. And I will live my life.” At the same time, the actress has found love again with model and actor Oli Green.</p><p>Reflecting on her career then and now, Miller is also grateful for all of it - the highs and lows. “It was a blessing post-motherhood to have that resurgence of a career that had slightly gone awry,” the actress said.</p><p>“I’m playing a long game and just trying to be good in things. I want to be doing this when I’m 80. Hopefully, when I’m an old lady and I look back at the choices I made, they’ll make sense. It’ll be a good meaty body of work.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And after Anatomy of a Scandal, Miller is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eager to do some comedy</a>. “From now on, it’s comedies and levity. I’m going to be tap-dancing and singing, and that’s all I want to do,” she remarked. “I don’t know that I’ve got any more ways to cry than I’ve shown. That’s it—that’s all I’ve got.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dpLmlecisZKyhlaO7onnMoqOlnaJixKmt02agrGWjnbJusM6ipaBlnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
