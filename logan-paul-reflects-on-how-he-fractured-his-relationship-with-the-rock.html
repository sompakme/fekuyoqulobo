Paul later took the video down and apologized, but the damage had already been done.</p><p>On the most recent episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMPAULSIVE</a>, the current WWE United States Champion opened up about his past relationship with The Rock and why the two men are no longer on speaking terms.</p><p>“DJ [Dwayne Johnson] was one of the people I hurt [via the Japan video] because of his mother’s experience,” Logan Paul revealed. “That’s his experience to tell, and I’m not going to share. But, like, I hurt him. So much so that he basically wanted nothing to do with me, and rightfully so, I let down my hero. And he requested that I remove all the content that we’ve ever done together and basically kicked me to the curb.</p><h2>Losing his friendship with The Rock was hard for Logan Paul</h2><p>“I would have done the same thing. [A] guy in his position doesn’t want to be affiliated with a person who did something as reprehensible as that. And I remember being in such a low moment cuz, like, I knew I let myself down. I knew I let my fans down; I knew I let my family down. But my idol, too? Man, it just stung so bad, and it wasn’t like I got the call from him. I got it from the publicist.</p><p>“And it’s not like he did anything wrong, it’s just like… I think my ego told myself that I’m going to f***ing remember that, and if I ever become a ‘Great One’ one day like you, I’m going to remember this. And I’m going to remember the day I was discarded. Again, rightfully so; I don’t think I’ve ever been really able to truly let go of that.</p><p>“I got a lot of stuff to work through, I think, in terms of that and… I’m not even sure where to go from here. In terms of reconciliation, yeah, I don’t know. We are kind of swimming in the same world a little bit with the WWE, and I see him coming back here and there. And I know we are going to cross paths, and I just wonder how I’m gonna handle it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-logan-paul-underwent-therapy-following-the-japan-incident>Logan Paul underwent therapy following the Japan incident</h2><p>Paul would then go on to admit that he went through a tremendous amount of therapy after the incident to figure things out in his life.</p><p>“And then… F***. And then Japan happened, Japan happened,” Logan Paul said. “And… I could go into so much depth about my remorse, the place that I was in, and the faults that I made at that time in my life. I had to really rewire my brain, backtrack, and ask myself, ‘How did I let that happen? And what went wrong in my life where I thought that was okay?’</p><p>“And in that process, I did a lot of damage. It wasn’t something that was on the forefront of my mind, and I’ve had to do a tremendous amount of therapy and figure out what happened in my life that was so traumatic. Or didn’t happen where again, I did that.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>How was Logan Paul’s and The Rock’s relationship prior to Japan?</h2><p>Paul also stated that he and The Great One were pretty friendly with one another before the incident went down.</p><p>“You [John Cena] and Dwayne [The Rock] were like two people that I definitely looked up to a lot when I was trying to figure out the blueprint for my career that didn’t exist,” Logan Paul said. “Dwayne especially. My idol. My hero. [He’s in his own] The Universe, he was doing it. And to the highest degree. I wanted to be like Dwayne.</p><p>“So eventually, the same way I met you today, one day, I met Dwayne. He was just as cool in person as I thought he was on TV. He’s awesome; [we] made content together. Went mega viral. 70 Million views. 50 Million views. Linked up a couple of times. Visited him on the set of Ballers. I would have considered us acquaintances, at least… He was just great.”</p><p>It’s currently unknown if The Rock will be at the Royal Rumble this Saturday night, but if he is, there might be a chance for these two talented performers to bury their past issues with one another.</p><p><a href=#>Logan Paul Re-Signs With WWE: I Figured If This Is Going To Be A Full-Time Job, Maybe I Should Stop Treating It As A Hobby</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ2mmru1e9awnGhpZGiGd32TZqOon5GjerGt1KVkq52WobKkwNJmpqdlmKTEbrTEZp2rmZOpwrOxw2afoqtdp7KtrdOipqermJ69bsPIrZ9mrJiaerO7wqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
