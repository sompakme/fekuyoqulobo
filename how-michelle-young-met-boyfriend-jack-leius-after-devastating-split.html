Like, [he] is definitely not in Minnesota at this point. I gotta start traveling more because they’re not on the apps!’”</p><p>Thinking that Young had met “all” of her pal’s brother’s acquaintances, she asked if he’d play matchmaker. The friend subsequently pulled up Leius’ Instagram profile, and Young was intrigued that he only had “five pictures” before she found herself blushing over her physical attraction to Leius.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Michelle-Young-Didnt-Think-She-Would-Meet-My-Person-in-Minnesota-Before-Jack-Leius-Introduction.jpg><p class=p1>“I was like, ‘Well, is he a good person?’” Young added. “In my world, I thought I brought it up to this person but [Jack] also did within, like, 48, hours. … It was really weird.”</p><p class=p1>Young and Leius met later that night and immediately clicked.</p><p class=p1>“I think we spent the next four days together,” Leius told podcast host<strong> Ben Higgins</strong> and guest <strong>Trista Sutter</strong>. “And we were dating by Sunday.”</p><p class=p1>Young further speculated that their bond was a result of the “invisible string theory” that’s been popular on social media, explaining that they likely crossed paths as two Minnesota natives around the same age.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“We went through breakups at the exact same time,” she said. “We were going through devastating breakups [and] we were in the same stage of our breakups as we were going through ‘Not ready met someone’ [to] ‘Ready to meet somebody’ and then those few steps back. We go to all the same bars … the lake he grew up on, my family fishes [there] 24/7.”</p><p class=p1>Young’s romance with Leius is her first relationship since she <a href=#>called off her engagement</a> to <strong>Nayte Olukoya</strong>. During Young’s season 18 of <i>The Bachelorette</i>, she got engaged to Olukoya, 29, during the season finale. They split in June 2022, six months after their proposal aired.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6diuqqvx56jpZ1drry2usZmpJ6sXZe8urLRopynnF2frqS3jKWcoq2jYq6nwMSrZJ2dppbAta3ToqWgZaOluarAjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
