Given the character description on Episodes, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt LeBlanc struggled with the idea at the start.</a> However, he was promised that it would all be worth it. The actor explained the process behind the scenes with Variety, and why he ended up accepting a deal.</p><p>“I did have a reservation in the beginning. I wasn’t comfortable playing myself,” LeBlanc tells Variety. “But they said, ‘Well, we’re not making a documentary. If there’s anything you’re uncomfortable with, we’ll change it. We’ll get through it together.’ And it was because of my history with them that I really felt comfortable."</p><p>Creatively, LeBlanc also loved the script and how it poked fun at Hollywood. Looking back, the script was very much ahead of its time and very reminiscent to the types of 'reality' shows that are trending today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>LeBlanc reveals, "It was a very unique idea in how it made fun of Hollywood. There were shows that were about the business before, but this one really did it in an original way. There was a device in the show — the fact that Sean and Beverly were new to Hollywood, it allowed the show to explain Hollywood to them and therefore the viewer, so that it didn’t feel too “inside.”</p><p>It was another tough goodbye for LeBlanc once the show came to an end, but he clearly made the most of the opportunity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqykYrmmrsuapZxlopqztr%2FEnWStp12Wu7TDxKtkoaGjYq6osc2tZJqepJq%2FbrLRopynnKNisq%2BwxJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
