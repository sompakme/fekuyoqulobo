In interviews, he rarely talks about his wife of almost 20 years, Irish artist Yvonne McGuinness, and their two children, Malachy (17), and Aran (15), preferring to focus on his work engagements instead.</p><p>Now that he has left the role of Tommy Shelby behind after <a href=#>six seasons of the Birmingham gangster drama</a> and Christopher Nolan's hotly-anticipated movie Oppenheimer — in which he plays the titular role — has wrapped, the Cork-born actor can recharge and spend time with his family in Ireland before committing to more projects.</p><p><strong>Updated on April 4, 2023:</strong> Since finishing Peaky Blinders in 2022, Cillian Murphy has spent the last year working hard to balance family life and Hollywood. So far this year, the star was hired to provide his voice for the video game Peaky Blinders: The King's Ransom, as well as worked on three upcoming titles: Oppenheimer, 28 Months Later, and Kensuke's Kingdom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both McGuinness and Murphy work hard to shield their sons from any unwanted spotlight, so their two boys cannot be found on social media and tend to stay out of any interview converstaions Cillian has while working.</p><h2 id=how-did-cillian-murphy-meet-his-wife-yvonne-mcguinness>How Did Cillian Murphy Meet His Wife, Yvonne McGuinness?</h2><p>Yvonne McGuinness has witnessed Murphy's career evolve, having been by his side from his early acting days. The two met in 1996 at one of the actor's jazz funk band shows — Murphy used to play guitar, sing, and write lyrics for The Sons of Mr. Green Genes and turned down a record deal at the time — and later tied the knot in 2004. The pair welcomed their two sons in 2005 and 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/yvonne-mcguinness-and-cillian-murphy.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Murphy started acting in the mid-1990s, making his stage debut in 1996. His breakthrough role on the big screen was in the zombie cult production 28 Days Later from director Danny Boyle.</p><p>The Irish star has never looked back since then, often collaborating with other big names in the industry. Notably, Christopher Nolan is among them: Murphy has appeared in The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and Dunkirk, and will be seen in the Oppenheimer movie this summer.</p><p>Despite his growing fame, he has always been elusive and reluctant to share details about his private life, his family above all.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I didn't see myself as a personality</a>. I see myself as an actor," he told The Irish Times in 2021.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Batman 2 May Feature The Joker Character And Put Bruce Wayne In The Spotlight</a></span></p><p>"I think those are two distinct jobs.

In June 2021, the actor explained he and his family moved back to their native Ireland "to be closer to family," admitting it was "the best thing [he and his family] did."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is The Peaky Blinders Movie Already In Production?</a></span></p><p>"The kids are of a certain age.
