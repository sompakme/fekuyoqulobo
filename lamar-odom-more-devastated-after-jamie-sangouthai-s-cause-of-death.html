County Coroner's Office confirmed what caused the death of <strong>Lamar Odom</strong>'s best friend, <strong>Jamie Sangouthai</strong>, a source tells <strong>Us Weekly </strong>that the former NBA player is even more distraught.</p><p>The coroner's office confirmed to <strong>Us </strong>on Thursday that Sangouthai died from a flesh-eating bacterial skin infection (necrotizing faciitis), as well as IV drug abuse. "Lamar just found out the results and is even more devastated," the source tells<strong> Us.</strong> "Because he didn't know Jamie was suffering so much and using needles."</p><p class=p1>The athlete visited Sangouthai’s grieving mother, Christine, on Wednesday, June 17, another source confirms to Us.</p><p>The insider says the former Lakers star, 35, has received support from close friends, including his ex <strong>Khloe Kardashian.</strong> "He's taking it really bad," the source tells <strong>Us</strong>. "And is asking for space to reflect."</p><p>But the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is not going anywhere. "She's been a major support for him," the insider tells <strong>Us</strong>. "They talk all day long and she calls almost every hour to check in on him."</p><p>Sangouthai had known Odom and Kardashian for years, and even appeared on their 2011 spinoff series, Khloe & Lamar. A source told<strong> Us </strong>earlier this week that Odom has been <a href=#>"beside himself" with grief</a>. "He feels like it could have happened to him," a source said of the former NBA pro, who has battled with his own substance abuse issues. "He feels like it could have happened to him. This is a huge wake-up call for him. It has really shaken him."</p><p>As of Wednesday, June 17, Sangouthai's body was still located on the West Coast. His former classmates from Christ the King High School in Queens, N.Y., started a <a href=#>GoFundMe</a> page to <a href=#>help his mother bring him home</a> and help lay him to rest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"As most of you know, our good friend and CK classmate has passed away," two old friends wrote in the fundraising plea. "Jamie Sangouthai will be missed by so many. Unfortunately, there aren't enough funds to bring him home. I spoke to his childhood friend Leo [Penizzotto] and we are doing a fundraiser to help his mom give him a proper burial."</p><p class=p1>An insider tells Us that it’s true Odom didn’t offer to pay for any of the costs related to flying his friend back to New York or the burial. “It’s very expensive and he’s not in a position to do that,” the source says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZ2Wv267w6ikZqWfp7JusMSvmKyskamypXnAn6ueql2frq61xGaqmqaXpMK1tMCiqmabkarApnnOn2SdnZGptW5%2Bj2psanBmZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
