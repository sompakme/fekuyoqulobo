Video vixen <b>Karrine Steffans</b> wrote a new essay in response to <b><a href=#>Beyoncé</a></b>’s <i>Lemonade</i>, in which she claims that she had a fling with <b><a href=#>Jay Z</a></b> and is the now-infamous “<a href=#>Becky with the good hair</a>.”</p><p>In the article, <a href=#>published on xoJane</a> on Friday, April 29, she wrote, “Over 15 years ago, I had Beyoncé’s husband. Yes, I was one of Jay Z’s Beckys back in the year 2000 for about three minutes, which is about as long it takes me to satisfy a man in the back of a Maybach while overlooking the beaches of Malibu.”</p><p>The actress, who made her debut at the age of 21 in Jay Z’s “Hey Papi” music video, pointed out that their rendezvous was “pre-Yoncé,” as the rapper, 46, and Queen Bey, 34, didn’t link up until 2002 after their collaboration “’03 Bonnie & Clyde.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Karrine-Steffans-Claims-She-Had-a-Fling-With-Jay-Z-%E2%80%98I-Am-Becky-With-the-Good-Hair-Beyonce.jpg><p>“This was pre-Yoncé, of course, but the fact is that a Becky is a Becky, and I was the Becky for many men, and they were all my salvation and my destitution,” she noted. “They were my reason and my rationale, my life and my death, and eventually, my fame and my infamy.”</p><p>Steffans claims that she and the “Holy Grail” entertainer had some “time alone” together one night after shooting the video.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Karrine-Steffans-Claims-She-Had-a-Fling-With-Jay-Z-%E2%80%98I-Am-Becky-With-the-Good-Hair-Jay-Z-Karinne-Steffans-music-video.jpg><p>“Chauffeured away from the set, down the winding road, and closer to the shoreline, Jay and I feasted on our attraction to one another — rabidly and quickly,” she wrote. “After just a few minutes, I lifted my head from his lap, wiped my lips, and knew we’d made a mistake.”</p><p>The model added, “Over the next few years, I would see Jay again, as I became close with his then business partner <b>Damon Dash</b>. We never mentioned our Malibu melee and acted as if it never happened.”</p><p>“As I make my way out of the pain and depression caused by my marriage [to <b>Columbus Short</b>] and the falling away of that marriage, <i>Lemonade</i> was released at the perfect time, and has given me a soundtrack to my healing,” Steffens, 37, tells <i>Us</i>. “My xoJane essay, <i>I Am Becky with the Good Hair: And I Am Also Beyoncé</i>, is part of that healing. I resonated with every last bit of <i>Lemonade</i>, its imagery and its lyrics, drawing a succinct line between myself as the ‘other woman’ and myself as the wife, realizing I have felt self-inflicted shame as both. Metaphorically, I wanted to express that, an expression to which many women can relate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Karrine-Steffans-Claims-She-Had-a-Fling-With-Jay-Z-%E2%80%98I-Am-Becky-With-the-Good-Hair-Karrine-Steffans-and-Jay-Z-split.jpg><p><span>Beyoncé released her new visual album, </span><i>Lemonade</i><span>, last week. In one of the controversial new tracks, titled “Sorry,” she slams her lover for being unfaithful with a woman that she simply refers to as “Becky.”</span></p><p>The lyrics quickly went viral as the Beyhive accused several women, including fashion designer <b><a href=#>Rachel Roy</a></b> and singer <b><a href=#>Rita Ora</a></b>, of being the mysterious mistress.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaKntq%2BxjKyrnp6Wlru0echmrpqrXZ%2BuunnZrGSbnZOgxm7DyK2fZqyYmnqou86dZKGZmad6uH6PbW5pbl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
