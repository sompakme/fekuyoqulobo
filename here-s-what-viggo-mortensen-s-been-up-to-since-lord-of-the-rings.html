Naturally, he has amassed an incredible <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a>, and he has built an amazing legacy for himself in the business. After all this time, Viggo continues to work and wow audiences with his acting abilities.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what has the acclaimed actor been up to since appearing in </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lord of the Rings</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>? Let’s take a look at just how busy he has been!</span></p><h2 id=academy-award-nominations>Academy Award Nominations</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A4D1FFDE-0390-4FD6-9F28-3D84E3981665.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Any actor as good as Viggo Mortensen is sure to please fans and critics alike with stellar performances, but it is rare to see someone nab multiple Oscar nominations. For Viggo, his work since </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lord of the Rings</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> has been instrumental in keeping him at the top of the pile.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in 2007, just a few years after his time in the trilogy was up, Viggo would land a role in the film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Eastern Promises</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, which was an amazing movie. It was a stark contrast from playing Aragorn, and he wound up delivering a performance for the ages. He would be nominated for an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, which would be the first of his career.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite having good performances in other projects, it would be some time before Viggo would find himself nominated for another Oscar. In 2017, Viggo was once again in awards contention thanks to his memorable performance in the film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Captain Fantastic,</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>&nbsp;according to&nbsp;IMDb</span><i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> Once again, he would leave the ceremony without the award, but getting his second nomination must have felt incredible.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Despite not winning either Oscar, the actor was still doing quite well for himself. Just two years later, Viggo would take part in a movie that went on to surprise a lot of people. Not only would he find himself up for some hardware, but the film itself made waves as it did better than most were anticipating.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things You Didn’t Know About Making The Fellowship Of The Ring</a></span></p><h2 id=best-picture-oscar>Best Picture Oscar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/66752909-3943-4D5A-B9DD-55CF3EFF1D3D.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>After years of churning out solid performances, Viggo Mortensen was 0 for 2 at the Oscars. Despite this, he was still doing his thing and making waves. In 2019, things seemed like they might change for the performer after starring in the film </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Green Book</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The movie itself earned some incredible reviews from people, and it was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, according to </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>IMDb</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. Incredibly, Viggo would also receive another nomination for his performance in the film. While the films had some hype, no one was anticipating what happened next.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>The film took home the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>, completely shocking the entertainment industry. While it was a great film that had a lot to like about it, many people felt that it would go down as one of the least memorable Best Picture winners in history. Nevertheless, all the hard work that the cast and crew put into making the movie clearly paid off in the end.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mortensen, despite doing his thing in the movie, once again left the ceremony without an Oscar to his name. Despite missing out on the award, it was still a huge night for him, as his film took home the biggest award of the evening. Not only that, but his third nomination cemented him as one of the best performers of his era.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Viggo was on a roll, but his fans were always wanting to see him circle back to Middle Earth. Turns out, Josh Gad had just the right idea to get the Fellowship back together.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Lord Of The Rings Was So Hard To Film</a></span></p><h2 id=one-reunion-to-rule-them-all>One Reunion To Rule Them All</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/A6985990-C6AF-49BF-8CC8-A46B4480462B.jpeg><p><span style=font-weight:400>Having been away from Middle Earth for years and going on to achieve greatness, things could not have been going better for Viggo Mortensen. However, the Horn of Gondor must have been blowing earlier this year, as Viggo got back together with the Fellowship!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Josh Gad’s YouTube channel had a brilliant idea to reunite casts from some of the best movies in recent memory, and when it was announced that the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lord of the Rings</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> cast was on board, fans were patiently waiting to see how things would play out.</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thankfully, their reunion episode was nothing short of amazing, and seeing Viggo with the rest of the cast made all of those that grew up with the trilogy feel young again. The cast had a chance to reminisce and tell interesting stories, and it really showed how much chemistry they still have after all these years.</span></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lord of the Rings Props: Who Took What</a></span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Viggo Mortensen is as decorated as it gets in the entertainment industry, and we can’t wait to see what he does next.
