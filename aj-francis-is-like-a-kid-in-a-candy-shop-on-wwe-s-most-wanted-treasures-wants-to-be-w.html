My story is different. I played in the NFL, I got a master’s degree, I have two albums, and I’ve been on tour for my music, but I never stopped loving wrestling. I went to every indie show I could, and I went to&nbsp;WrestleMania&nbsp;five different times before I ever signed. My dream is to be WWE champion. Until I’m WWE champion, my purpose on earth is not complete.”</p><p>In the meantime, Francis explained why he’s enjoying his role as the host of a WWE program that lets him interract with some of the company’s all-time greats. As a passionate wrestling fan, Francis shared his hope that the viewers can life vicariously through him.</p><p>“That’s why it’s so cool to host this show,” said Francis. “It’s the coolest thing to ever happen to me. I hope every wrestling fan watching sees a little bit of themself in me.”</p><p>“…This show isn’t scripted, it’s entertaining…Kicking it with Undertaker and Kane, I’m like a kid in a candy shop. I’m a mega fan, I can relate to the fans, and that’s why I’m here. I’m not playing a character. That’s me.”</p><p>Fans can watch “WWE’s Most Wanted Treasures” Sundays at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFsa21wZGKuq3nFq5inm5moerjDxKxkpqejqXq4rc2tnJ1lpKeyor%2FUq5ysZZuesW61zWaYZpuRo7G6edKtpqud</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
