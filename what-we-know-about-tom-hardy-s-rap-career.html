The <strong>Venom</strong> star no doubt has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a remarkable acting career</a> but what many don't know is that he is also a rapper... a pretty good one at that. Surprised? We were too! But if he is half as good as we claim, why you might be wondering if he has any released songs and of course if there is a future for him in rap. Read on to find out all of these and more!</p><h2 id=he-started-rapping-as-a-teenager><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Started Rapping As A Teenager</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of people discover their passion and interests quite late in life but for some, it comes to them very early. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy</a> was one of the latter. It took him only a few years to discover his love for rap and he pursued it relentlessly for a while. During an interview, Hardy revealed that his music journey as a young boy. " I started out ­rapping when I was 14 or 15", he said. With all his years of experience writing and rapping, it really is no surprise that he is so good at it.</p><h2 id=hardy-did-not-think-he-was-any-good><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hardy Did Not Think He Was Any Good</span></h2><p>Despite discovering and starting off pretty early as a teenager, Hardy faced a problem that plagues many even till today...the nagging feeling of not feeling good enough. In his earliest days, the actor did not think he was any good at rapping. He has in the past attributed his not-so-successful career in rap to this. "Because I come from a nice middle-class neighborhood, it was a very hard sell And I wasn't very good," Hardy said in a previous interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Hardy Went To School With This 'X-Men ' Star</a></span></p><h2 id=but-he-was-in-a-record-label><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>But He Was In A Record Label</span></h2><p>Hardy might not have believed in himself and his rap game, but there were people who did...prolific producers and talent scouts. The actor once recalled having a record deal and working with Grammy award-winning producers Warren Riker and Gordon Williams. He also admitted to once working with Lauryn Hill and Pras's manager. Hardy doubted himself but these men clearly have a thing for great talents!</p><h2 id=he-has-many-unreleased-songs><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>He Has Many Unreleased Songs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During his time with the record label, Hardy wrote and recorded a bunch of tracks that were never released. "I've recorded loads of stuff but it's never been released. I've got albums, man. My best friend Peanut, he grew up in the south Bronx. He's a very good MC and we still play. It'll come out in a film one day, it'll come out in a character somewhere," the actor said during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his 2011 interview with BBC</a>. After revealing this, fans wondered if they would actually ever get to hear some of Hardy's songs. It was not long before they got their answer!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Much Tom Hardy Made For 'Venom'</a></span></p><h2 id=and-a-released-project><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>And A Released Project!</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps after coming to terms with the fact that he was indeed talented, Hardy decided it was time to introduce the world to his sound. In 2018, the actor released Falling on your Arse In 1999, an 18 track mixtape that he initially recorded in 1999. The project featured Hardy as Tommy No 1 and the producer Ed Tracy going under the name Eddie Too Tall. The two men go way back and often inspired each other to get creative back in the day. Now, Tracy is also quite successful in his own right with a BAFTA award to his name.</p><h2 id=he-left-rap-for-acting><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>He Left Rap For Acting</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing that rap was not for him, Hardy delved into another part of entertainment...acting. Though his career in film dates back to the late 90s, it was not until a few years ago that he got his big break. In 2015, Hardy was cast in five different movies including Mad Max: Fury Road and The Revenant. For his role in the latter, the actor received his first Academy Award nomination and has since made a name for himself as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of Hollywood's most hardworking actors</a> and there is no disputing this. One thing is evident; Tom Hardy works hard and well! Little wonder he has become a fan favorite!</p><h2 id=but-there-might-be-more-to-come><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>But There Might Be More To Come</span></h2><p>Falling On Your Arse might be Hardy's first released project but it won't necessarily be the last. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While speaking to Complex in 2018</a>, Tracy detailed the build-up to the mixtape's release, revealing that it was the actor who asked that they put it out there. He said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Tom asked me whether I still had the album kicking about it in the loft. He'll be pleased with the reception it's had today. We always said we'd do a Vegas tour as a joke. Maybe if this album generates enough love then we can coax Tom onstage."</p><p>So acting might be going on well for Hardy but who knows, we just might see him explore his rapping talents in the years to come. And when or if that happens, there is no doubt it will be everything and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bundle of talent thorough and thorough! Love us a multi-talented man!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Is Tom Hardy's Son, Louis Thomas?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsSmecqnprBlkZe8tsCMraamZZiWv6XF0mapmqhdmK6zscSrZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
