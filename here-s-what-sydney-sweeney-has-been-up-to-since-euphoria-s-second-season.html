She has had some very minor roles in popular shows like Heroes, Criminal Minds, the 90210 reboot, and even Grey's Anatomy while also making time to star in indie films and shorts to help build up her acting resume.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans with a keen eye may also remember seeing her in Hulu's The Handmaids Tale or MAX's miniseries, Sharp Objects before she was cast as Cassie Howard in Euphoria. Rather than let that role box her in, Sweeney has instead accepted other roles that allow her to show off her acting skills. Outside of working with streaming services, it seems that Sydney Sweeney may finally be getting her big screen debut courtesy of the <a href=#><strong>MCU</strong></a>, specifically in Spider-Man's neck of the woods.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-has-starred-in-some-amazon-originals>Sydney Sweeney Has Starred In Some Amazon Originals</h2><p>It would be easy for Sweeney to continue working with just MAX or Hulu since she already has an established relationship with both streaming platforms, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but IMDB shows</a> that the actress has also added working with Amazon Prime Video to her resume.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's Team Believes The Actress Missed Out On A 'Dumpster Fire' Losing The Role In Madonna's Biopic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sweeney starred in the Amazon Prime Original film Nocturne in 2020. Viewers were quick to point out the <a href=#>similarities between the film and Natalie Portman's Black Swan</a>, noting similar themes of artistic ambition turning obsessive and unhealthy, and what happens when your ambitions are driven by jealousy and envy.</p><p>She returned to work with Amazon Prime Video for 2021's The Voyeurs, which follows Pippa and Thomas, played respectively by Sydney Sweeney and Justice Smith, as they move into their new apartment, only to realize their windows face their neighbors, and Pippa develops a bit of an obsession with her neighbors lives.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nocturne-official-trailer-0-7-screenshot.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both films received lukewarm receptions, with Nocturne getting a 63% on Rotten Tomatoes, The Voyeurs scoring even lower at a 43%, and Google reviews weren't great either.</p><p>But these have not hindered Sweeney from being able to find other work in the form of TV streaming.</p><h2 id=sydney-worked-with-maxs-39-on-reality-and-the-white-lotus>Sydney Worked With MAXs' On Reality And The White Lotus</h2><p>Sydney Sweeney landed a role on The White Lotus, but apparently was almost not given the opportunity to do so. The actress admits that she had to fight and audition for the role and almost missed out on it because the <a href=#>producers weren't sure if she would be the right fit</a> to play Olivia Mossbacher.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sydney Sweeney's Endless Sponsorships May Bring Closure To Her Shocking Financial Issues</a></span></p><p>While Euphoria certainly helped her rise to fame, it is because of Euphoria that she almost missed out on the role due to the typecasting that seemed to follow after the show's first couple of seasons wrapped up. Sweeney explained that "They didn't think I was right for White Lotus because I did Euphoria."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She elaborated further, saying "So I put myself on tape, I auditioned for White Lotus just like everybody else and had a call back like everybody else."</p><p>Sydney Sweeney continues to break expectations with her role in the MAX-produced drama Reality, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on the true story of Reality Winner</a>, a US Air Force enlistee who leaked classified information.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rachel-meets-olivia-paula-by-the-pool-_-the-white-lotus-_-hbo-0-4-screenshot.png><p>Reality is an on-screen adaptation of an off-Broadway play that follows the same premise, all of which took place leading up to the 2016 presidential election. The film also uses direct transcripts from Reality Winner's actual interrogation, so Sweeney speaks the exact words Winner spoke prior to being arrested.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-is-officially-part-of-the-spider-man-universe>She Is Officially Part Of The Spider-Man Universe</h2><p>Perhaps one of the most prestigious things an actor can do now is star in a superhero film via either the DCU or the MCU, and it seems that Sweeney is getting the opportunity to do just that alongside actress Dakota Johnson, <a href=#>who fans have been comparing Sweeney to</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Halsey And Sydney Sweeney Actually Friends?</a></span></p><p>Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney will be starring in the Spider-Man spinoff Madame Web, produced by Sony Studios. Johnson will get to play the titular character, who has the ability to use telepathy, see into the future, and astral project herself outside of her body. Part of her abilities also allows her to transfer her powers to another body.</p><p>While the details of the film are not super well known, this could be where Sydney Sweeney's character comes in, as she is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to be playing Julia Carpenter</a>, who Madame Web transfers her abilities to. Julia Carpenter is known as Spider-Woman, Arachne, and Madame Web throughout the comic book franchise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar52187272.jpg><p>Details are still actively emerging about the film, like just exactly which version of Julia Carpenter Sydney Sweeney is meant to be in Madame Web, but the internet seems excited to be getting further expansion on the Spider-Man universe with the inclusion of some influential and pivotal female characters.</p><p>Either way, it's clear that Euphoria hasn't limited Sweeney's ability to land a diverse range of gigs in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKypZ2dqWLAuLHEp5yyZZSktq%2BzjKemsGWVqr2pu9GimGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
