Exercise, reading and spending time with loved ones are all key elements on the to-do lists of the some of the wealthiest and most successful people. But for many of us, taking on simple daily routines takes a lot of our time and energy, while the habits that might make us more successful get pushed to the bottom of the list. Though many celebrities probably have enough money to stay home and do close to nothing, it’s their daily routines that keep them hungry to pursue their goals for the long run. From supermodels to TV personalities, celebrities with a solid daily routine have the energy and focus to keep their star shining and their bank rolling year after year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-degeneres-mantra-magic>&nbsp;<b>Ellen DeGeneres: Mantra Magic</b></h2><p>After connecting with <a title="Russell Simmons Net Worth" href=#>Russell Simmons</a> during an interview on her show, <a title="Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth" href=#>Ellen</a> learned about Transcendental Meditation (TM) and the benefit it could have on her life. This technique requires the meditator to sit for 20 minutes each day, focusing entirely on a mantra.

When you’re President, days off are few and far between. For the 44th POTUS, keeping daily rituals is the key to maintaining his health, work, sanity and family. <a title="Barack Obama Net Worth" href=#>Mr. Obama's</a>&nbsp;eat breakfast with his wife and daughters every morning before beginning his day at the Oval office.

Jagger credits his varied workout routine, practiced six days a week, with reducing his stress and amping up his trademark stamina. Mick hits the gym nearly everyday to take ballet classes, Pilates and yoga to keep his mobility up and his dance moves like…well, like Jagger.</p><p></p><h2 id=lady-gaga-me-time><b>Lady Gaga: Me Time</b></h2><p>Though she seems to always seek the spotlight, <a title="Lady Gaga Net Worth" href=#>Lady Gaga</a> has been upfront about the effect media attention has on her well-being.

But the 50-year-old designer breaks the pattern immediately after a healthy breakfast. After a double espresso and a cigarette, Jacobs heads to his closet for a little dress up. Donning a kilt and black (or white) shirt, Mr. Jacobs finally feels like he can be his best creatively. Marlboro cigarettes, like the kilt, are part of his everyday routine and have helped the couturier pump out designs for brands like: Dior, Vuitton and his own fashion labels. It really is all about balance.</p><p></p><h2 id=miranda-kerr-mini-meditations><b>Miranda Kerr: Mini Meditations</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Contrary to popular belief, working supermodels don’t laze around all day in lingerie, drinking Champagne. These girls work hard particularly at this time of year. It’s not uncommon for a successful model to wear several outfits, in two or three shows a day, throughout Fashion Weeks’ the world over. Though <a title="Miranda Kerr Net Worth" href=#>Miranda Kerr</a> has been successful enough to dial back her work hours, she still keeps a pretty hectic schedule. For this supermodel, power meditation keeps her calm and grounded in a fashion madhouse. To make sure she stays on top and sane, Kerr fits in tiny bouts of mediation, whenever she has a spare moment. A few minutes in a makeup chair, in a taxi on the way to the airport, or waiting for a fitting to begin; for Miranda these are all golden opportunities to tune in and tune out the hectic world around her.</p><p></p><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow-family-and-fitness><b>Gwyneth Paltrow: Family and Fitness</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fit and formidable actress can dance, sing and cook. An entrepreneur at heart, <a title="Gwyneth Paltrow Net Worth" href=#>Paltrow </a>runs her health empire ‘Goop’, a family of four and her acting career.

As a mother and businesswoman, the <i>Ironman</i> actress limits herself to one movie a year so she can dedicate enough time to her family.</p><p>Each morning, Gwyneth cooks breakfast for her children and drops them off at school, stopping along the way for an early morning croissant, and story time with her son, Moses. Once the children are taken care of, Paltrow heads home to walk the talk of her Goop lifestyle, with a heart pounding two-hour workout. Between the family commitments and the 14 hours a week in the gym, it’s a wonder we see her in any movies at all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZxZaOqsKSx0qydrqRdmLKtscGroK2hlah6orrDZquhnZmneqWtyKWwZqqZqcKiuNJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
