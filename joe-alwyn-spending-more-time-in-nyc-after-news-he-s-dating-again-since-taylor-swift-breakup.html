As the insider explained that the actor was focusing on his career, they admitted that Joe Alwyn had a problem with fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Joe loves acting, but can’t stand the attention that comes with it," the source admitted. "<strong>He’s not comfortable in the spotlight</strong>."</p><p>Swifties have been speculating for a long time that one of the problems in the relationship was that the actor couldn't deal with the level of exposure that came with dating one of the biggest pop stars in the world, and this recent report only fueled the theory.</p><p>Then, of course, there's the theory about cheating. Swifties analyzed Taylor's new songs, and one stood out. "The Black Dog," which referenced an English pub by the same name, implied that <strong>she found out that Joe Alwyn was cheating on her because he forgot to turn off his location, and she found out he was lying to her and hanging out with another woman at The Black Dog</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mqqmdnpnAbsDIppxmpqmYeqWt06KloGWRnK6quoytmLKkn6d6tMPIn6tmmqKarqzBz2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
