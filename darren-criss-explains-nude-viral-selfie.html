Sammy Davis Jr. once said, ‘If they don’t talk about you, they don’t give a damn.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Criss also opened up about shifting his focus from acting to music while <i>American Crime Story</i> is on hiatus. “I’m concentrating mostly on my music and my band,” he said. “My band is called Computer Games and our debut came out in April. It’s a band with my brother and basically the project we have been working on our entire lives.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadmaKnsq95wqugrKtdmsWxuMCipaxlnqqxpnnVoqmapF2osq2yyJ5ksGxobYRzhY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
