They went on to welcome four children: son A.J. (Atiim Kiambu Jr.) in 2002, son Chason in 2004 and twin daughters Riley and Ella in 2010.</p><p>One month before their baby girls’ arrival, news broke in April 2010 that the NFL player and his then-wife were separating. It was later revealed that <a href=#>Barber had an affair</a> with Johnson, who was an NBC intern while he was working at the <a href=#>Today</a> show.</p><p>“I didn’t want to interact with people,” he told Sports Illustrated in May 2011 of the aftermath of the relationship drama. “I didn’t have passion for life. It may have been a form of depression.”</p><p>The Game Day author began his broadcasting career in 2007 after <a href=#>retiring from football</a>, but his NBC contract was not renewed in the wake of his cheating scandal.</p><p>“I had a bad marriage. I left. It doesn’t mean I’m a bad father. I fell in love with someone else,” Barber noted in his May 2011 interview. “You’re walking down a path, and you know it’s not right. Do whatever it takes to change. Sometimes it’s easy. Sometimes it’s violent. Mine was violent. But somehow it seems right. … In dealing with life — whether it’s divorce or pleasing the boss — sometimes it’s just not in your hands. You’re dealing with [the] emotions and realities of other people.”</p><p>In July 2012 — just over one week after his divorce from Cha was finalized — Barber and Johnson tied the knot in a civil ceremony in New York City. While marking their ninth wedding anniversary, Johnson reflected on how the couple chose to work through their highs and lows.</p><p>“9 years later and every dinner out with you still feels like a date. Here is to a marriage that is all about growth, learning, acceptance and unconditional love and loyalty,” she wrote via Instagram in July 2021. “There is no one better to be a life partner with than you. Thank you for 9 years of evolution, love, countless dinners at Cafe&nbsp;Lux and here is to a lifetime of more. #anniversary #marriage #love.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One month prior, reports surfaced that Johnson was eyeing a place on <a href=#>The Real Housewives of New Jersey</a> after she was spotted filming with several cast members including <a href=#><strong>Dolores Catania</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Melissa Gorga</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Teresa Giudice</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jackie Goldschneider</strong></a>. When the <a href=#>first trailer for season 12</a> dropped in December 2021, Johnson appeared as a “friend” of the Garden State reality stars.</p><p>Scroll down to relive the couple’s love story:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwaq3yGaZmqqSmr9uwNGamqJlnK67r3nJqJ%2Bnq5%2BjwG6%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6KllaG2r7GMqZ%2BorJ%2BofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
