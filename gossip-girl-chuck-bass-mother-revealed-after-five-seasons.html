On Monday night’s episode of Gossip Girl, Chuck Bass’ long-time search for his absent biological mother came to a surprising and unexpected end.
But instead of Chuck’s (Ed Westwick) personal private investigator delivering the news to him, the credit was given to his step-sister, Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively).
After eavesdropping in on media mogul Diana Payne’s (Elizabeth Hurley) phone conversation where she mentioned being at the hospital the night that Chuck was involved in a serious, near-fatal car accident, Serena realized that Diana was the family member who donated the blood that would save his life, making her his mother."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Unbeknownst to the pair, Serena’s newly discovered cousin Lola Rhodes (<strong>Ella Rae Peck</strong>) was live broadcasting their private conversation to Gossip Girl, which was sent out in a blast to everyone’s phone in the room.</p><p>As Diana walked towards her son, Chuck backed away, furious over the realization that his biological mom had been in New York for several months and was hooking up with Nate Archibald (<strong>Chace Crawford</strong>), who is also Chuck’s best friend — all without him knowing who she really was.</p><p>“I wanted to watch over you from afar,” Diana, who gave birth to Chuck while his father, Bart Bass (<strong>Robert John Burke</strong>), was married to another woman, told him later when she attempted to talk to him back at his Empire Hotel apartment.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Nate’s bed is not that far,” Chuck responded, referring to his roommate Nate’s trysts with Diana.</p><p>Hopefully April 23’s episode will answer the question: Will Chuck, whose father is now dead, come around to the idea of a real mother-son relationship?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6oq6OevW6zyKujZpuYqrCsecGaqqxlnaTBqbHRZqmerpWWuaawjJqdrZ2iYrOqwsRmqp6Zo6S7tHmRaWhraWdpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
