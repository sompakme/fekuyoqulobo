The Mentalist actress, 40, tells <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> exclusively that she's engaged to boyfriend <strong>Nicky Marmet</strong>. Tunney accepted Marmet's proposal on Christmas Day in Rio de Janeiro — but it was actually his second attempt at popping the question.</p><p>"He'd made an earlier attempt at the beach in Bahia, but I had what I thought was Dengue Fever and I threw up over his shoulder when he was about to take the ring out," she told Us of a recent vacation to Brazil. "Mercifully, I recovered and was healthy enough to accept the second time."</p><p>"I was shocked," she added. "I was too ill to notice anything was up in Bahia so he'd caught me completely off guard."</p><p>The actress tells Us that Marmet, an interior designer, is an "amazing man" and did a great job picking out the "beautiful rock" on her finger.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"The diamond was from his grandmother Mimi's engagement ring and was reset by Ann Marie Stanton, a jeweler and dear friend of mine in Beverly Hills," she recounted. "It means so much that it was his grandmother's. She had a long and happy marriage to his grandfather. I like to think it's good luck!"</p><p>This will be Tunney's second trip down the aisle. Tunney — whose film credits include The Craft, Vertical Limit and End of Days — was previously married to producer/director Bob Gosse from 1997 to 2002.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarp5Keu27A1KelnrFdqbWmecyepa2ZnJ7AtXnSrZirZZmoeqa6xpqenpxdqbxuusicorJlnZa%2FrrHTZmlpaWNqf3A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
