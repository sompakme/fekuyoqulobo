Since fantasy fans everywhere embraced Pullman’s highly engrossing stories, it was only a matter of time before they were adapted for the screen. Sadly, however, <a href=#>plans to adapt the novels into a series of films were abandoned</a> after the first movie in the series, The Golden Compass, flopped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A BTS Look At The Witch Council In 'His Dark Materials' In Season</a></span></p><p>Fortunately for anyone who wanted to see "His Dark Materials" be fully brought to life on their screens, the BBC opted to adapt the novel series into a TV show. More than that, a series of incredibly talented actors were hired to star in the His Dark Materials series. Given all of the talented actors who star in the show, it has left some fans to wonder how the His Dark Materials cast stack up against each other in terms of net worth.</p><h2 id=dafne-keen-ndash-net-worth-500-000><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Dafne Keen – Net Worth: $500,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For most longtime comic book movie fans, <a href=#>Logan is the X-Men movie that is better than all the rest</a>. While there is no doubt that several actors played a key role in that film’s success, Dafne Keen’s amazing portrayal of Wolverine’s young clone Laura simply blew moviegoers away. With that in mind, it makes sense that Keen was tapped to play the central role in His Dark Materials, Despite landing a pair of high profile roles, Keen is still very early in her career which is why she only has a $500,000 fortune according to celebnetworths.com.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Dark Reason Hugh Jackman Took A Paycut For 'Logan'</a></span></p><h2 id=ruta-gedmintas-ndash-net-worth-1-million><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Ruta Gedmintas – Net Worth: $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Ruta Gedmintas’ impressive career, she has starred in several shows including The Innocence Project, Lip Service, and The Strain. Despite all of those roles, it could easily be argued that Gedmintas is best known for playing a powerful witch in His Dark Materials. As a result of those roles and all of the other shows and movies she has been a part of, Gedmintas currently has a $1 million fortune according to idolnetworth.com.</p><h2 id=lucian-msamati-ndash-net-worth-1-5-million><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Lucian Msamati – Net Worth: $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, it is very clear that Hollywood isn’t a true meritocracy. After all, Lucian Msamati would have become a much larger star by now if it was. On the bright side, Msamati has gotten the chance to flaunt his obvious acting skills several times including when he portrayed Game of Thrones’ Salladhor Saan and His Dark Materials’ John Faa. Hopefully, Msamati’s career will take off even more in the years to come which will allow him to accumulate more than the current $1.5 million fortune celebworth.net reports he has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clarke-peters---1-5-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Clarke Peters - $1.5 Million</span></h2><p>Anytime producers are looking for an actor that can instantly imbue a character with a sense of authority, there should be one person they call first, Clarke Peters. Arguably best known for his amazing performance in one of the best shows of all time, The Wire, Peters has also stood out in a lot of other projects. For example, Peters’ work in movies like Harriet and Da 5 Bloods as well as shows like Treme and His Dark Materials is incredibly impressive. According to celebritynetworth.com, Peters’ long career has allowed him to accumulate a $1.5 million fortune.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Cast Of 'The Wire': Who Is The Richest Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anne-marie-duff-ndash-net-worth-1-9-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Anne-Marie Duff – Net Worth: $1.9 Million</span></h2><p>As of the time of this writing, Anne-Marie Duff is not a household name internationally. Despite that, anyone familiar with Duff’s career will know how great she was in shows like the original version of Shameless, The Virgin Queen, and Sex Education as well as several notable films. As a result of all those roles, Duff has a $1.9 million fortune according to networthlist.org.</p><h2 id=adewale-akinnuoye-agbaje-ndash-net-worth-3-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje – Net Worth: $3 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For some His Dark Materials fans, it is likely to be confusing to see Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje appear on this list. After all, Akinnuoye-Agbaje hasn’t appeared in a single episode of the popular show to date. However, it has been announced that Akinnuoye-Agbaje is set to be a part of the show’s upcoming third series which is great news for His Dark Materials fans everywhere. Akinnuoye-Agbaje likely is excited as well since the $3 million fortune he has according to celebritynetworth.com will grow as he continues to land highly sought-after roles.</p><h2 id=ruth-wilson-ndash-net-worth-7-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Ruth Wilson – Net Worth: $7 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the year 2020, Ruth Wilson won the BAFTA Cymru Best Actress award for her amazing work as His Dark Materials’ Marisa Coulter. As anyone who has seen His Dark Materials will likely already know, Wilson deserved that award and it is a crying shame that her trophy case isn’t stuffed due to her work in the show. On the bright side, starring in His Dark Materials has played a role in Wilson having a $7 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=james-cosmo-ndash-net-worth-8-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Cosmo – Net Worth: $8 Million</span></h2><p>During James Cosmo’s long career, he has played a supporting role in a long list of movies that will go down in history. For example, Cosmo played a memorable part in movies like Highlander, Braveheart, and Trainspotting. On top of that, Cosmo also was impressive in several shows including Game of Thrones, His Dark Materials, and Sons of Anarchy. Since Cosmo has been in high demand throughout his career, celebritynetworth.com reports that he is worth $8 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andrew-scott-ndash-net-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Andrew Scott – Net Worth: $10 Million</span></h2><p>Over the years, Andrew Scott has been outstanding in a lot of roles including as His Dark Materials’ Colonel John Parry. Despite that, it seems indisputable that Scott is best known for his stunning performance as Sherlock’s incredibly crafty villain Jim Moriarty. Based on the strength of that portrayal, he continues to be a highly sought-after actor which has allowed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott to accumulate a $10 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=terence-stamp-ndash-net-worth-10-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Terence Stamp – Net Worth: $10 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Terence Stamp was included in His Dark Materials’ opening credits, he is worthy of inclusion in this list even though he didn’t appear in many episodes of the show. Obviously a legendary actor, Stamp has starred in so many movies and shows that it would be foolhardy to try to list his career highlights here. Based on that fact, it makes sense that Stamp is worth $10 million according to celebritynetwoth.com.</p><h2 id=james-mcavoy-ndash-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>James McAvoy – Net Worth: $20 Million</span></h2><p>At this point in his career, James McAvoy is one of the biggest movie stars in the world. Best known for bringing Charles Xavier to life in several X-Men movies, McAvoy has also starred in a slew of other hit movies including Split and Wanted. Based on his impressive box office record, McAvoy has the clout to demand huge paycheques which has allowed him to accumulate a $20 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phoebe-waller-bridge-ndash-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Phoebe Waller-Bridge – Net Worth: $20 Million</span></h2><p>Since the year 2016, Phoebe Waller-Bridge has been one of the most important voices in television as the star of Fleabag and the creative mind behind that series and Killing Eve. For His Dark Materials fans, it is also worth noting that Waller-Bridge voiced John Parry's daemon Sayan Kötör. Due to all of those roles and the fact that she voiced L3-37 in Solo: A Star Wars Story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waller-Bridge has a $20 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><h2 id=lin-manuel-miranda-ndash-net-worth-80-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Lin-Manuel Miranda – Net Worth: $80 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of the time of this writing, it could easily be argued that Lin-Manuel Miranda is one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry. After all, Miranda is in high demand as an actor and it seemed like every film and television producer would do just about anything to be able to hire Miranda to write music for their project. Unsurprisingly, Miranda’s powerful position in Hollywood has allowed him to accumulate an $80 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Is Lin-Manuel Miranda The Richest 'Hamilton' Performer?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifoqtdma6zt4ymmK2dop6urb%2BMnJisrF2jsrV51qipraBdp8K1tIywoKWrn6N6rbXNp2SmmZ6qsq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
