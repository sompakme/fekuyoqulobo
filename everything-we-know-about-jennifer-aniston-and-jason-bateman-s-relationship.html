In fact, some<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> celebrities go on to develop close ties with fellow actors </a>over the years. This seems to be a case for Jennifer Aniston, a veteran actor who became known for her work in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hit television sitcom “Friends.”</a></p><p>Throughout her career, she has become friends with several actors, including Jason Bateman. As you know, Bateman is an equally respected actor in Hollywood. Through the decades, both he and Aniston have enjoyed flourishing careers. They’ve also developed quite a friendship. Here’s what we know about their relationship:</p><h2 id=they-first-met-on-a-tv-show-that-he-was-starring-in><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>They First Met On A TV Show That He Was Starring In</span></h2><p>According to reports, the two first met on the TV show, “Simon,” although Aniston was not involved in that project. She once told Relevant magazine, “I’ve known him for so many years, since I was 25 years old when a friend was doing a TV show with him. He was in a much different mental space back then, but still lovely and great and I’ve just always adored him. He’s just delightful. There’s nothing about him that isn’t squeezable.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=soon-after-the-two-went-on-a-ski-trip-together><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Soon After, The Two Went On A Ski Trip Together</span></h2><p>While speaking with E!, Aniston and Bateman shared memories. Aniston recalled, “We went to a holiday party in Aspen, Colorado. It was a holiday party…and we were at that guy's house, and you drove the Range Rover backward with the door swung open up the street.” She added, “We were all renting a house together, 25-years-old. We went to that party though, it wasn't our own party, but that happened.” Bateman commented, “A lot of fun stuff happens in the mountains. It's the altitude!”</p><h2 id=the-first-time-the-two-worked-together-was-on-the-2006-film-the-break-up><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>The First Time The Two Worked Together Was On The 2006 Film “The Break-Up”</span></h2><p>Around this time, Aniston has already done a number of films, including “Along Came Polly,” “Bruce Almighty,” “Rumor Has It…,” “Derailed,” “Friends with Money,” and “The Good Girl.” In the film, Aniston’s character, Brooke Meyers, goes to war with her boyfriend Gary Grobowski, played by Vince Vaughn. Meanwhile, Bateman plays Riggleman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-actors-collaborated-once-again-for-the-film-the-switch><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>The Two Actors Collaborated Once Again For The Film “The Switch”</span></h2><p>At one point, the film was called, “The Baster”, and Bateman told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a>, “It’s a romantic comedy with Jennifer Aniston. It’s less than traditional. There’s some sperm swapping going on there.” He also mentioned that he’d never worked on a romantic comedy until he got cast in this film, opposite one of his closest actor friends.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harvey Weinstein Said Jennifer Aniston Should Be Killed</a></span></p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-truly-believes-that-jason-bateman-is-different-from-other-child-actors><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston Truly Believes That Jason Bateman Is Different From Other Child Actors</span></h2><p>While attending Bateman’s Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony, Aniston explained, “One thing has proven itself to be true and that is having longevity in this business is not easy. Especially starting out as a child actor. Usually that's a story that doesn't always end well.” The actress also quipped, “When I actually met Jason it was kind of looking like it could go either way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-two-partnered-up-again-for-the-ensemble-film-horrible-bosses><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>The Two Partnered Up Again For The Ensemble Film “Horrible Bosses”</span></h2><p>During an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Sugar</a>, the film’s writer, Michael Markowitz, revealed, “When I wrote the script — I always have actors in mind when I was writing. And Jason Bateman and [Jen] were the actors I had in mind.” Markowitz also turned to Aniston and added, “I never knew if it was like, rude, to tell you that I thought of you for that part.”</p><h2 id=a-few-years-later-they-also-starred-in-horrible-bosses-2><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>A Few Years Later, They Also Starred In “Horrible Bosses 2”</span></h2><p>Bateman and Aniston reprised their roles for the sequel. They were also joined by Jason Sudeikis, Charlie Day, Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, and Chris Pine. For Aniston, filming some of her scenes with Bateman was a bit difficult. She told HuffPost, ‘I've known him for 25 years. We've practically grown up together. You know, his wife is one of my best friends. So it was just a little--there was that moment of like, "Oh this could be awkward. This could be awkward. This is my brother.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=then-they-went-on-to-star-in-office-christmas-party-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Then, They Went On To Star In “Office Christmas Party” Together</span></h2><p>The film represents a milestone for the two longtime friends. In a featurette, Aniston remarked, “This is our fifth movie together, I think. It’s something like… it almost doesn’t feel like work.” Meanwhile, Bateman also said, “Jennifer and I have known each other twenty years now. Like with anybody in any profession, if you can work with your friends, that’s something you’d look to do.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston And Jimmy Kimmel Help A Nurse In The Best Way</a></span></p><h2 id=she-refers-to-him-as-her-partner-in-crime><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Refers To Him As Her Partner In Crime</span></h2><p>While continuing on with her speech in honor of Bateman, Aniston also remarked, “He's a fantastic partner in crime, the most generous man that makes the world laugh and cry on a dime. Oh, and he's a vicious negotiator. I have been in the room, and I have witnessed it. Do not poke that bear.”</p><h2 id=they-are-so-close-that-jason-bateman-believes-he-s-got-enough-dirt-on-his-best-friend><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Are So Close That Jason Bateman Believes He’s Got Enough Dirt On His Best Friend</span></h2><p>While speaking with The Guardian, Bateman jokingly remarked, “Well, I've got a great deal of dirt on Ms Aniston, and as long as she continues to hire me for her projects I will not show the pictures.” He also added, “We've always just really gotten along well. I think I was just fortunate to be a good fit for parts in her films.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-lovingly-refers-to-him-as-grandpa><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Lovingly Refers To Him As ‘Grandpa’</span></h2><p>While honoring Bateman, Aniston also revealed, “The part that I'm really the luckiest, that I get to witness as his friend, is Jason Bateman the husband, the fantastic father, the dear friend and as we lovingly call him: Grandpa. He looks 12. He acts 100. A head of hair that women envy. He works hard. He's tired. Even in his most restful state, he's one of the loveliest men to be around.”</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-went-on-vacation-with-jason-bateman-and-his-wife-to-cabo><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston&nbsp;Went On Vacation With Jason Bateman And His Wife To Cabo</span></h2><p>At one point, Aniston and her now-ex-husband, Justin Theroux, traveled with Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka, to Cabo, Mexico for a New Year’s vacation. A source told Us Weekly, “Jason Bateman’s wife convinced Justin to go to Cabo. She has been the mediator in recent months, trying to get Jen and Justin to work through their problems and save their marriage. The Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin. They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it.” Unfortunately, Aniston and Theroux broke up soon after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melissa Etheridge Spills The Beans About Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt’s Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=after-she-broke-up-with-justin-theroux-jennifer-aniston-was-spotted-at-jason-bateman-s-movie-premiere><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>After She Broke Up With Justin Theroux, Jennifer Aniston Was Spotted At Jason Bateman’s Movie Premiere</span></h2><p>Aniston may have been heartbroken, but that never stopped her from supporting her longtime friend during the premiere night of his film, “Game Night.” However, this time, Aniston chose to avoid the red carpet. Instead, she went straight inside the venue, while Bateman avoided commenting on his best friend’s romantic life. We’re pretty sure Aniston had a great time once the screening was underway.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-rang-in-2020-with-jason-bateman-and-some-other-good-friends-in-wyoming><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jennifer Aniston Rang In 2020 With Jason Bateman And Some Other Good Friends In Wyoming</span></h2><p>To welcome the New Year, Aniston, Bateman, and the rest of their good friends decided to spend some time in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. The actors were joined by Jimmy Kimmel, and Amanda Anka, who is Bateman's wife. By now, you may have realized that this group has a tendency to vacation together quite frequently.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-bateman-and-his-wife-were-around-when-jennifer-aniston-had-a-run-in-with-ex-brad-pitt><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jason Bateman And His Wife Were Around When Jennifer Aniston Had A Run-In With Ex, Brad Pitt</span></h2><p>As you know, everyone was talking about that moment that Pitt met up with his ex-wife, Aniston, at the SAG Awards. As you could expect, Bateman and his wife were also at the event. In fact, Aniston was seen having dinner with the couple at the Sundown Tower resort’s Tower Bar later on. Many thought Pitt would join the group, but he was never spotted in the area.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Of Jennifer Aniston’s Biggest Roles, Ranked From Not Watchable To Lovable</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRit6a6zaKdnqpdlruqv9OopWaZnpl6q63SqKVmmpGpsq6tzaxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
