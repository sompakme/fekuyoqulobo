He fell in love and won the Super Bowl, can't get any better than this. <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>'s support has been a very important thing for him since they made their relationship official, and he was moved almost to tears as he hugged her after his big win. The pop star literally traveled halfway across the world (she had been playing four concerts in Japan) to go see him at the Super Bowl, and neither of them are likely to ever forget that day.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-handles-the-pressures-that-comes-with-dating-taylor-swift_bk_a1_v2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Travis Kelce Handles The Pressures That Come With Dating Taylor Swift</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce appears to be well-prepared to handle the pressures that come with dating a superstar like Taylor Swift.</span><p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows, but nothing ever is. Travis Kelce's older brother <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, who, as much as he adores Taylor, has been outspoken about his concerns for the couple's exposure.

As happy as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are together, the attention they've been getting since they made their relationship public is not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Taylor has been dealing with the highest level of exposure for most of her life, so as annoying as it probably still is, she's used to it.

Recently, one of her stalkers has gotten arrested many times for lurking around her house, and she's had to issue a warning to a man who was tracking her flights.</p><p>Knowing all this, Jason has been worried about the couple's (and especially his brother's) safety for a while, as he had the feeling that something like this could happen when he started seeing paparazzi around Travis, and reports of everything he did.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's a hard line to walk for the older brother</a>. "<strong>On one hand, I’m happy for my brother that he seems to be in a relationship that he’s excited about, that he is genuine about. But there’s another end of it where it’s like, 'Man, this is a lot.' There’s paparazzi talking about him fueling his car before the game today and I’m like, 'Is that really necessary information to share?'</strong>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hopefully, as Taylor and Travis settle into their relationship, the excitement of the new romance will die down, and the power couple will be able to live, if not peaceful, relatively safe lives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqufo3qsscucnGavn6e%2FqrHDZpibp6WpeqO%2Bzq2fnqpdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbsDRmq2iq12brqSx0maqnq6Vp7Juv8CfnK2xXZi8r6%2FEq6WsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
