I can't believe it. It's so nice to be able to talk about it and share it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her GMA appearance, Swank also went on to appear in Live with Kelly and Ryan where she also spoke briefly about her pregnancy. “It’s such a blessing,” the actress said. “It’s a total miracle.”</p><p>Later on, Swank also revealed on The Drew Barrymore Show that her twins are due on her late father’s birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=filming-alaska-daily-made-hilary-swank-realize-she-should-lsquo-tell-people-soon-rsquo-about-her-pregnancy>Filming Alaska Daily Made Hilary Swank Realize She Should ‘Tell People Soon’ About Her Pregnancy</h2><p>Ideally, Swank wanted to keep her pregnancy under wraps. But while filming the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she realized that would be almost impossible to do</a>.</p><p>“You don’t tell for 12 weeks for a certain reason. But then, like, you’re growing and you’re using the bathroom a lot and you’re eating a lot,” the Oscar winner said.</p><p>Not to mention, she also started to struggle to fit into her costumes, and that ultimately convinced her that she had to make the announcement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilary Swank Fired Her Entire Team After Attending A Party She Wasn't Supposed To</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“There was a moment just last week when my pants didn’t fit anymore, and I had to like cut ... my pants, and then I put a jacket on over it like I had to hide it, right?

I knew about the missing, murdered indigenous women, I knew about that. But the story was just [shocking],” Swank said.</p><p>“To me, I knew about that, and yet so many people don't know about it and it's happening right now, right this second, and no one's doing anything about it, it is horrific and something needs to be done.”</p><p>And while the actress was passionate about doing the show, filming while expecting was an entirely new experience for the Oscar winner. Not to mention, Swank was also new to early pregnancy pains.</p><p>“I’ve never been pregnant before and being able to now have a deeper understanding of what women have gone through for so long, the nauseousness and the exhaustion, and especially in the first trimester,” she explained.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Call Hilary Swank An 'Enigma' In Hollywood For This Reason</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the end, it made filming quite a unique experience for Swank this time around. “We work 15-hour days and a TV series is like a marathon, so some day are six-day weeks and we have 30-minute lunches,” Swank recalled.</p><p>“And look, I’m not complaining because I love my job, but when you ask, like, ‘What is it like to be pregnant during that?’ It’s definitely a different set of circumstances.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnbatrdGyZKyvkaO4bq3Np6auppOasW60xKtkqaqVnLuiusKyZJ6ZoqHGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
