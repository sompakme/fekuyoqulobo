In fact, it wasn’t until they had split up that the 8 Simple Rules actress first broke the news to the public.</p><p>“[Our relationship] was such a huge part of my life and no one knew about it,” Cuoco said to CBS! Watch Magazine in 2010, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Us Weekly</a>. “It was a wonderful relationship but we never spoke a word about it and never went anywhere together.

At the time, he was only eight years old. The actor was born in the Bree city of Limburg, Belgium, where his father was stationed as a rehabilitation teacher by the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>Together with his family, Galecki relocated to the States when he was still quite young, and he grew up in Oak Park, Illinois.</p><p>Some of his future castmates on The Big Bang Theory are actually very extensively educated beyond high school: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayim Bialik is a real-life neuroscientist</a>, with a PhD in the field, while Jim Parsons has a Masters Degree in Acting from the University of San Diego.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What's Kaley Cuoco and Johnny Galecki's Relationship Like Today?</a></span></p><p>Galecki himself never achieved such levels of education, as he actually dropped out of high school after one day. He did go on to acquire a high school diploma through private tutoring, but never went to college afterwards. Still, his 35-year-long career has helped him to amass <a href=#>a net worth of $100 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-kaley-cuoco-richer-than-johnny-galecki>Is Kaley Cuoco Richer Than Johnny Galecki?</h2><p>There are multiple parallels between Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco’s lives and careers. Apart from starring in The Big Bang Theory, they both lack a college degree, and also started out as child actors.</p><p>Cuoco’s very first professional screen role was a character called Connie Reinhardt in the film Quicksand: No Escape, which also starred Donald Sutherland and Felicity Huffman. She graduated high school at the age of 16, at which point she had already been recognized by Forbes as one of the highest paid actresses on TV.</p><p>Their parallel paths have unsurprisingly led to them accumulating a very similar amount of wealth to date. In fact, Celebrity Net Worth estimates that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cuoco is also worth $100 million</a>, exactly as much as Galecki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The California-born star is currently starring as a flight attendant in the similarly-titled series on HBO Max, for which she also serves as executive producer.
