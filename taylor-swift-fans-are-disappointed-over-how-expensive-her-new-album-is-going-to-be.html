The four bonus tracks include "The Manuscript," "The Bolter," "The Albatross," and "The Black Dog," each edition featuring a distinct color and cover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Priced at $34.99 per vinyl version, with standard delivery bringing the total to $47.99, dedicated fans eager to obtain all four editions, will be just shy of $200 at checkout, which is a high price to pay just to get access to all bonus tracks. Additionally, digital downloads will be available for $11.99, CDs for $12.99, and cassettes for $19.99.</p><p>Swift's strategy of releasing multiple variants is not unprecedented; she previously offered six vinyls of Midnights, five of 1989 (Taylor's Version) (one featuring the bonus track "Sweeter Than Fiction"), and ten of Folklore, all with the same standard tracks. This move sparked mixed reactions among fans on social media, echoing previous debates over the cost of being a Taylor Swift enthusiast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even for fans who weren’t able to get their hands on tickets, Taylor found a way to further monetize her Eras tour thanks to its feature lengths film, which debuted in theatres. She then made an exclusive Deal with Disney+ in December in which Swift introduced a rental version of the Eras Tour movie, priced at $19.89 for a 48-hour viewing window.</p><h2 id=fans-are-angry-for-taylor-for-monetizing-her-content-so-much>Fans Are Angry For Taylor For Monetizing Her Content So Much</h2><p>With the news of how expensive Taylor’s upcoming album is, <a href=#>some fans are angry at the growing cost</a> of being a diehard Swiftie.</p><p>“Im over the cash grab of the multiple variants. It’s ridiculous. Im not spending money on one vinyl just for another to drop,” one person wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “She’s a billionaire. I get that she’s trying to go for the “5 Stages of Grief” concept with the vinyls but cmon… at least make them cheaper.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_johnny-depp-s-paintings-sold-for-almost-as-much-as-he-d-make-from-his-movie-salaries_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Ex-Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>From John Mayer to Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift has dated quite a few celebrities, and they all have hefty bank accounts.</span><p>Another person tweeted, "I love Taylor Swift with my whole heart, but that marketing of having 1 exclusive for separate variants is so greedy and unnecessary!
