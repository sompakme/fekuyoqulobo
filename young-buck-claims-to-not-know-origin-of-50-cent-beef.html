Buck revealed he was late to record the show with Steve-O because he had received a call regarding the debt, though he claimed that the Queens rapper had missed some “deadlines” of his own.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We was once brothers. I’ve always looked at you as big bro,” Young Buck said, directing his comments at 50 Cent before questioning if he was being treated like one of the rapper’s biggest rivals. “Yes, I made mistakes too but I’ve never did anything to try to take food out of your mouth or stop you from eating. See how aggressive he is to me, is he trying to Ja Rule me?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In June, Buck put his <a href=#>catalog up for auction </a>in hopes of making enough money to clear his debt with his former boss. <a href=# rel=nofollow>AllHipHop</a> reported on Wednesday (Jan. 10) that there is an ongoing bidding war that has hindered the sale from going through. Middleton Open Season Partners claimed they were willing to pay $740,000, but Structured Asset Sales objected and claimed they could pay more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for his boss-turned-enemy, Fif threw a few shots at him and Lloyd Banks while on <a href=#>The Final Lap Tour</a>. “They think this is something? Wait ‘til they see Lloyd Banks’ tour,” he joked in a video. “Wait ’til they see&nbsp;Straight Outta Cashville,” he said in reference to Buck’s 2004 debut album.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX668trrGZpmum5tiu7DAjKSlqK9dpL%2Bqs8inZG5oXZiyr8CMm5yenl1mf3SAl2xwbWpoZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
