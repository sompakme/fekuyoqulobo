I didn’t find those couples that I wanted to root for,” he admitted, adding that he’s “been very happy” to support the show for the past four years. “When it comes to genuineness, I think, on every season there are people who are open to getting married, there are people who want to get famous and there are people who fall somewhere in the middle.”</p><p>Cameron continued, “And for me watching, of course, I want to see people who have that true connection and who genuinely want to get married.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Cameron-Hamilton-and-Wife-Lauren-Speed-Hamilton-Declined-Reunion-Appearance-on-Love-Is-Blind-158.jpg><p>As for season 6, Cameron felt it was less about the search for love and more about “all the memes, it’s all the one liners, it’s all the drama. The mess.”</p><p>However, he noted that he doesn’t place blame on the cast for <a href=#>“playing into that.”</a> Cameron pointed out that fans love to discuss the drama online, adding, “Now, season six, the cast is well aware of how the show works.”</p><p>“I didn’t hear anything about the one couple that did get married on this season. It was all about everyone else,” Cameron said.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While season 6 of Love Is Blind was filled with drama, one couple — <strong>Amy Cortés </strong>and<strong> Johnny McIntyre</strong> — <a href=#>did exchange vows</a>&nbsp;during the show’s finale episode.</p><p>Cameron noted that he will “be forever grateful” to Love Is Blind for giving him Lauren and his “wonderful” platform.</p><p>“For Lauren and I, Love Is Blind was just the beginning of our story and we’re working on so many wonderful projects together,” he said. “I’m grateful to have a partner that I can work with. It’s truly a blessing and thank you for supporting us for the last four years. It really means the world to me.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqapZWnvK95x5qkoqSkpLtuuMCuqZ6mXai9prHDZpuem5yeu6awjKWmr51dnsBursuipZ1loprCr7XOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
