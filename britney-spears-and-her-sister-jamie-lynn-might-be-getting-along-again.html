From entering superstardom at a young age to having a very public mental health breakdown and conservatorship battle, fans of the pop queen know that her life has been a continuous uphill batter for her freedom, even against her own family. And while her father was the one in charge of her conservatorship, <a href=#>Spears still had a strained relationship with her mother</a>, sister, and even her sons. While the conservatorship under her father has ended, and the relationship between Spears and her mother is still rocky, the tide may be changing for her sister Jamie Lynn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney Spears surprised fans with an Instagram post about her younger sister that was relatively positive in nature, something that Spears has not done for any member of her family that isn't her sons or Sam Asgari in quite some time.</p><h2 id=britney-posted-a-heartfelt-message-to-her-sister>Britney Posted A Heartfelt Message To Her Sister</h2><p>In a move that shocked fans and spectators alike, Britney Spears posted a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loving message to her younger sister Jamie Lynn Spears</a>. This was the first time Britney had posted something positive about her sibling after having spoken poorly about her just the year before.</p><p>Even more surprising was that the post happened on December 2nd, Britney Spears' birthday. In a now-deleted caption, Britney wrote "It's my b-day but you're my heart so I'm thinking about you. Congratulations on being so brave, inspiring, and showing guts and flory in your show!!! You ain't alone...if anybody knows what that feels like...I get it! My baby sister!!! I love you!!!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Tom Cruise And Britney Spears Almost Got Cast For The Lead Roles In The Notebook">Tom Cruise And Britney Spears Almost Got Cast For The Lead Roles In The Notebook</a></span></p><p>Followers of Britney's Instagram page had incredibly mixed reactions to the post, which is still present but with the original caption deleted.</p><p>While some found the post to be sweet and endearing, focusing on how Britney is expressing love even when they have been having a tough time as a family, others were quick to point out that she can still love and miss someone that has hurt them.</p><p>Before the conservatorship happened, Britney and Jamie Lynn spears appeared to have a close bond with one another and were often seen photographed together, with Britney supportive of her younger sister's acting career on shows like Zoey 101.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other spectators were confused by Britney's post about her sister, with some calling the post concerning. Many users began using the Free Britney hashtag again, something that was widely used during the conservatorship battle until Britney was granted her freedom.</p><h2 id=the-two-previously-were-not-on-speaking-terms>The Two Previously Were Not On Speaking Terms</h2><p>Britney Spears has certainly been vocal about her disdain for her immediate family, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and her sister was not spared at all</a>. Early on in the conservatorship battle, fans of Britney were quick to call out Jamie Lynn for not publicly supporting the Free Britney movement.</p><p>Jamie Lynn was quick to let fans know that she has "supported [her] sister long before there was a hashtag. And I'll support her long after. Note that."</p><p>Throughout the conservatorship battle, Britney appeared to counteract this statement, saying that her sister did not always support her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Britney Spears Claims Family Was Harder On Her Than Jamie Lynn In New Twitter Post">Britney Spears Claims Family Was Harder On Her Than Jamie Lynn In New Twitter Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney also called her sister out for performing remixed versions of her songs at an awards show, telling her fans "My so-called support system hurt me deeply." Britney continued to post her thoughts about her family, including jabs at Jamie Lynn until she ultimately responded back to her big sister.</p><p>In an Instagram story post, Jamie Lynn speaks directly to her sister, saying "Britney-Just call me, I have attempted many times to speak to you directly and handle this privately like sisters should, but you still choose to do everything on a public platform."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jamie Lynn also asked Britney to stop telling the public that she has never been there or supportive of her and that the entire situation has been <a href=#>"embarrassing and has to stop."</a></p><p>Britney went on to call her sister "scum" on social media before seeming to backtrack some of the things she said. Britney's public feud with her sister continued after Jamie Lynn released her book, which Britney said is filled with lies.</p><h2 id=fans-speculate-that-britney-is-not-in-charge-of-her-social-media-pages>Fans Speculate That Britney Is Not In Charge Of Her Social Media Pages</h2><p>While many fans of both Britney and Jamie Lynn Spears are happy to see the two sisters making an attempt to repair their relationship, others are reasonably confused about the post. With the original caption now deleted, many are wondering if Britney is the one in charge of her social media pages.</p><p>Fans of Britney are quick to point out that many of the posts are taken in her old home, which she and Asgari had allegedly sold months ago, while others noticed that there are a lot of old or throwback posts being put up in place of newer updates from the pop star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Is Sam Asghari Making Britney Spears' Family Feud Worse?">Is Sam Asghari Making Britney Spears' Family Feud Worse?</a></span></p><p>Several pages on Instagram, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like Britney's.deleted.posts</a>, have popped up to archive original captions, photos, and Instagram posts Britney puts up before they are ultimately deleted completely, or reposted with a new, edited caption.</p><p>Regardless of whether Britney is the one posting on her own social media pages or not, seeing a positive post about one of her family members was certainly a surprising change for her fans, and it's a change that many hope signals a repair in the relationship between two siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dl7%2BqwM2esGaroJqus7%2BMmqWdZZqWuqqxjKWwp6ZdpLtus86om2aslae6tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
