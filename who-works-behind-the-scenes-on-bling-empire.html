That’s probably the best description of the reality series Bling Empire. This Netflix show is an instant hit, praised for its representation and “cultural celebration” of Asian Americans. This show follows the lives of East Asian socialites in Los Angeles, California as they enjoy their materialistic and sometimes drama-filled days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TV Guide’s Diane Gordon praised the first season’s compelling and colorful characters, while another critic said anyone watching it will want to live their lives “vicariously through the participants.” Though the extravagance of the stars is often highlighted, the Bling Empire also illustrates Asian American culture -- a much-needed representation. The show looks so superficial – well, it’s a reality show – that some <a href=#>people wonder if it’s scripted</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Cherie And Jessey's Relationship Is Called Into Question On Bling Empire ">Cherie And Jessey's Relationship Is Called Into Question On Bling Empire</a></span></p><p>The series is binge-worthy and fun to watch because, as they say, it’s that kind of show where the viewer won’t need to analyze things. East Asians would love it all the more because it’s a celebration of their culture, albeit extravagant. After all, the stars are socialites. Everyone knows the cast, and it’s time to meet the <a href=#>team behind this successful show</a> that’s reportedly on the way for a third season and a spin-off. As one reviewer said, "move over Kardashians."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quick-look-at-the-cast><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Quick Look At The Cast</span></h2><p>The stars of the show are so rich that fans might be wondering <a href=#>what they looked like before Netflix</a>. Businessman Kevin Kreider narrates the show and turns out to be its number one defender against those saying it’s tone-deaf and shallow.</p><p>Kreider takes the audience on a rollercoaster journey with cast members real estate developer Kane Lim, husband and wife Gabriel and Christine Chiu, entrepreneur Kelly Mi Li, heiresses Cherie Chan and Anna Shay, business owner Jessey Lee, models Kim Lee and Andrew Gray, fashionista Jaime Xie, musician Guy Tang, and Season 2 newcomers Mimi Morris and Dorothy Wang. In total, their net worth is estimated to be $800 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jeff-jenkins><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jeff Jenkins</span></h2><p>Jeff Jenkins already established himself as a reality show producer, and with Bling Empire, he made sure he would remain an industry leader. His Jeff Jenkins Productions is the team behind other famous reality shows like Keeping Up with the Kardashians and its spin-offs, Total Divas that featured WWE wrestlers, The Simple Life starring socialites Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, and the Julia Haart-centered My Unorthodox Life. With such titles, it’s no wonder why Jenkins, alongside his co-producers, made Bling Empire a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christine-chiu><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Christine Chiu</span></h2><p>Aside from starring in the show, Christine is also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">among Bling Empire’s producers</a>. Dubbed the "couture queen," her fertility struggles were one of the issues highlighted during the show’s first episodes. Christine was among those who made it possible for the show to be enjoyed on Netflix. Even before Bling Empire, she has been working on television projects, so much so that she almost became a part of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Christine is really a star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="'Bling Empire': Are Anna And Christine Talking?">'Bling Empire': Are Anna And Christine Talking?</a></span></p><h2 id=kelly-mi-li><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kelly Mi Li</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like Christine, Li stars in the show and produces it. She was in a relationship with co-star Gray during the first season, with fans questioning their dynamics because of alleged red flags and abuse. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They eventually broke up</a>, with Li parting ways with the show, too.</p><p>Her departure is controversial as Li accused her co-producer Jenkins of not crediting her as among the show’s creators. The businesswoman claims she created the concept of the Bling Empire. The issue ended in a formal complaint, with Li accusing Jenkins of exploiting her “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">concept and materials</a>” without proper episodic fees and without crediting her as an executive producer. It’s not known yet if the two already settled their differences.</p><h2 id=brandon-panaligan><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Brandon Panaligan</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another producer of the show is Brandon Panaligan, who is passionate about Bling Empire as it’s an opportunity to further Asian representation in mainstream media. “When I had the opportunity to come into a show where Asians were going to be front and center, I thought it was an amazing, amazing chance,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Filipino-American said</a>.</p><p>He has been in the industry for a decade and has produced other shows such as Shahs of Sunset, Deaf U, Big Brother, and Made In Mexico. Panaligan is among those who insist that the Bling Empire has depth and there’s something to learn from it all the while enjoying the characters’ drama and extravagance.</p><h2 id=ross-weintraub><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ross Weintraub</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ross Weintraub is among Bling Empire’s veteran producers as he has been in the industry for around two decades. He is the chief executive officer of 3 Ball Media Group, of which Jenkins’ JJP is a part. He also started 3 Ball Productions (formerly 3 Ball Entertainment), the production team behind <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first 11 seasons</a> of the successful The Biggest Loser and its related shows Extreme Weight Loss and I Used to be Fat; the dating shows For Love or Money, The Pick-Up Artist, and Beauty and the Geek; and other reality series for various channels. With his long experience in the field, Weintraub knew how to make the Bling Empire the success that it is today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# title="Does 'Bling Empire's' Kane Lim Really Work For Jason Oppenheim's Brokerage?">Does 'Bling Empire's' Kane Lim Really Work For Jason Oppenheim's Brokerage?</a></span></p><h2 id=elise-chung><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Elise Chung</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Bling Empire showrunner is Elise Chung from Bunim Murray Productions, where Jenkins previously worked.

Such shows include Jersey Shore, Untamed & Uncut, Chivas: El Rebaño Sagrado, and Unfiltered: Paris Jackson & Gabriel Glenn, among others.
