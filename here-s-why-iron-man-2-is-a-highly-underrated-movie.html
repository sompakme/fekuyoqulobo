Of course, the action sequences in&nbsp;Iron Man 2&nbsp;are flimsy, and there's not much going on in the movie....unless you pay good attention. Once you begin noticing the minute details of the film, you have an epiphany...Iron Man 2&nbsp;actually kickstarted the MCU, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it began the journey of a man named Tony Stark</a>, and it paved the way for the final showdown of the Avengers vs Thanos.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From Iron Man To Endgame, These MCU Moments Changed Everything</a></span></p><h2 id=iron-man-2-gave-a-glimpse-inside-the-howard-stark-tony-stark-relationship>Iron Man 2 Gave A Glimpse Inside The Howard Stark-Tony Stark Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/John-Slattery-as-Howard-Stark-in-Iron-Man-2-GeekTyrant.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tony Stark grew up in the shadow of Howard Stark. He feared his father, avoided much interaction with him, and even restrained himself from getting too close to him - because he thought that his father never loved him, or even liked him.</p><p>The reluctance of pouring his heart out in front of Howard Stark kept Tony locked in a shell of guilt, despise and regret. Until he watched his father's old recordings provided to him by Nick Fury. In one of these recordings, Howard Stark sheds away his strict, rigid, fearsome persona and reveals the soft-hearted father hidden behind it. Howard Stark leaves a video recording for Tony Stark, finally unraveling his true love for his son:</p><p>"Tony, you are too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you, and someday you'll realize that it represents a whole lot more than just people's inventions. It represents my life's work. This is the key to the future. I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day, you'll figure this out.
