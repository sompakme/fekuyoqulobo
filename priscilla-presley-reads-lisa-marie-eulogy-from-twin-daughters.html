Lisa Marie Presley was an icon, a role model, a superhero to many people all over the world, but Mama was my icon, my role model, my superhero in much more ways than one.

She was delicate, but was filled with life,” the New York native read during the service. “She always knew she wouldn’t be here too long, childhood passes by with a glimpse of her green eye she then grew a family of her own. Then came her second child leaving her with suspicion, could this be the angel that takes me home?”</p><p class=p1>She continued: “Time of course flew by, it was time for a tragedy. She knew it was close to the end, survivor’s guilt some would say, but a broken heart was a doing of her death. Now, she is home where she always belonged, but my heart is missing her love. She knew that I loved her, I fear I’ll never touch her, but the old soul is always with me. She doesn’t drift above.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>After concluding the twins’ note, Priscilla remarked that their poem “says it all.”</p><p class=p1>“Thank you all for being here. <a href=#><strong>Navarone [Garibaldi]</strong></a>, her brother, thank you for being here,” she concluded, referring to her son with ex <a href=#><strong>Marco Garibaldi</strong></a>. “And the family, of course, and all of you.
