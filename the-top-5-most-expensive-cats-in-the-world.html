Cats actually make good pets as well, because of their independent nature and general cleanliness. It is now the most popular pet in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cats have been domesticated since the Neolithic period, though the first certain signs that they were adopted as pets came in ancient Egypt. Known for its incredible breeding rate, cats are known to be excellent companions for humans. They also have the ability to hunt down rats, vermin, and other household animals that humans consider as pests.</p><p>Cats may have different looks and personalities, so people can choose one depending on his own preference. Shy and introverted owners may opt for the aloof American Curl, or maybe even the Scottish Fold. Those with gregarious personalities who are outgoing will definitely prefer a Manx or a Birman. These two breeds actually have traits similar to a dog. If you are after a cat’s looks, prim and proper owners will do well with the Siamese, while those who are rough by nature may want a Maine Coon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some cats are more rare and more beautiful than others. The combination of rarity and beauty has brought about unbelievable prices for this animal.&nbsp; Here is a list of the top five most expensive cats in the world today.</p><h2 id=1-the-ashera---125-000><strong>1. The Ashera - $125,000</strong></h2><p>DNA tests have indicated that these are actually Savannah cats, but these have not stopped Ashera lovers from praising the beauty of this feline creature. The Ashera is not a pure bred cat in the real sense of the word, as it is a result of the hybrid of genes from several cats, namely the domestic housecat, the Asian leopard cat, and the African serval. The result is a domesticated cat that looks just like a leopard.</p><p>The Lifestyle Pets Company, the company that created the cat, breeds only five Asheras each year. The ones with patterns similar to a snow leopard are sold for as much as $125,000. The other Asheras can be had for as low as $22,000, though the average price has hovered at around the $28,000 range. The Lifestyle Pets Company has recently focused on the creation of hypoallergenic Asheras, however, costing $37,000 each. It is still much more than what you would pay for an average cat, but then again, the Ashera is more than just your average cat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-the-bengal---42-000><strong>2. The Bengal - $42,000</strong></h2><p>Bengals are not that rare, with almost 60,000 of this breed all over the world. Its beauty, however, was enough for an Englishwoman named Cindy Jackson to pay $42,000 for a Bengal cat in 1998. The cat was named Fur Ball, and it definitely cost more than a ball of money.</p><p>The Bengal is a result of a hybrid between domestic cats and the Asian Leopard Cat, or the ALC. Its scientific name is the Prionailurus Bengalensis Bengalensis, thus the name Bengal. Their coating is similar to that of the magnificent leopard, though its shape and nature resemble that of a domestic cat. The Bengal is extremely popular because of its wild appearance that features large spots, light tummy and rosettes, just like the Asian leopard. Its temperament would become similar to a domestic cat once it is removed by at least three generations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Experts advise, however, that Bengals be kept as pets only if it is removed by four generations already. The first three generations should be used for breeding purposes only.</p><h2 id=3-the-savannah---22-000><strong>3. The Savannah - $22,000</strong></h2><p>The Savannah is a hybrid cat out of a domestic cat and the African serval. It was created in 1986. A first generation savannah that is half serval can cost as much as $22,000. The value can go down, as the generation gap from the first gets farther.</p><p>The Savannah is a large domestic cat. Though slim, the cat’s tall built gives it the appearance of an imposing size that is greater than its actual weight. Just like the price, the size will go down as the generations start to pile up. Some countries do not allow it to be owned domestically, however, so be sure to check first with your local animal board. Australia, for one, does not allow Savannahs to become pets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you do buy this cat, however, take special precautions because of the Savannah’s tremendous leaping ability. It can jump as high as 8 feet even from a standing position, meaning refrigerators, high shelves and cabinets and tops of doors are fair games for them. Its inquisitive nature also allows it to open doors, cabinets, and cupboards.</p><p>The Savannah is a very sociable cat so long as it is properly exposed to people and other pets while growing up. It is loyal to its master, and it may hiss upon seeing an unknown person.</p><h2 id=4-the-sphynx---3-000><strong>4. The Sphynx - $3,000</strong></h2><p>Also known as the alien cat, the Sphynx is a seemingly hairless breed that emerged in Canada in 1966. Its skin is like chamois, and it is usually covered with vellus hair. The lack of pelt, however, means that it has a tendency of cuddling up against people and other animals to keep itself warm. It features a strong body, heads shaped like a wedge and potbellies.</p><p>The Sphynx is an extremely intelligent breed. It likes to climb and is very lively. It does require a lot of attention, but it more than makes up for it by its loyalty.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-the-peterbald---3-000><strong>5. The Peterbald - $3,000</strong></h2><p>The Peterbald is just like the Sphynx, only it developed in Russia instead of Canada. Its main feature is its blue eyes. It is affectionate and energetic, and can live peacefully with other pets. It is also a loyal cat, as Peterbalds are known to follow its owners wherever it goes.</p><p>The cat is well built, though in a graceful and elegant way. Its ears are set apart, while its eyes are shaped like almonds. It can hold on to objects and even open doors using its webbed feet and oval paws.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGasn6V6dnnMqKqtZZWtvaa60qKtnmWTlsG0ecinZK2glWLEsL7LnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
