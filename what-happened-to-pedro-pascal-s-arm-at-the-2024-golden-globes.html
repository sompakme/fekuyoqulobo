Pascal, 48, arrived at the awards ceremony in an all-black look with a surprising accessory: a sling.
“I fell!” he told reporters on the red carpet. “Be careful. It can happen to anybody.”
The actor was first spotted with the injury on photos posted by actress Jaime Ray Newman on January 2, taken at an apparent New Year’s Eve celebration."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Pascal is nominated for Best Actor in a Television Series – Drama category for his starring <a href=#>role as Joel Miller</a>. Ramsey, who plays Ellie, is recognized in the Best Actress in a Television Series – Drama category.</p><p>The HBO show is also up for Best Television Series at the awards ceremony, which took place nearly one year to the day after The Last of Us debuted on the network.</p><p>The Last of Us found widespread success almost immediately after it aired in January 2023. Its first episode became HBO’s second-biggest debut in over a decade with 4.7 million viewers across HBO and Max streaming service. Viewership nearly doubled in March of that year for the season 1 finale, which brought in 8.2 million people watching across the two platforms.</p><p>The show helped turn Pascal into an even bigger star — and cemented him as <a href=#>the internet’s daddy</a> thanks to his affinity for playing father figures. However, the actor admitted that playing Joel was “totally scary” because The Last of Us video game had such a giant fanbase.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/The-Last-of-Us-Pedro-Pascal-and-Bella-Ramsey-Reunite-at-2024-Golden-Globes-2.jpg><p>“It’s that funny thing of compartmentalizing your feelings about stuff and dealing with the amount of pressure on you,” he said during <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> Drama Actors Roundtable in May 2023. “I have this psychological game where I’m like, ‘It’s no big deal, nobody cares, nobody gives a s—t.’ But this time around, I was scared. I was so scared.”</p><p>He continued, “The was more of an exposed silhouette, a silhouette of coolness maybe, and an expectation to be met as far as what people’s immersive experience of the story was. And to disappoint them in that regard felt like it would be … I don’t know. You don’t want to let people down, but also nobody’s impervious to disappointing people. I want people to like me.”</p><p>Despite Pascal’s initial fear, The Last of Us was met with praise from viewers who played the video game and others who just watched the show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pedro-Pascal-Arrives-at-2024-Golden-Globes-in-Sling-After-Arm-Injury-2.jpg><p>Now, fans are getting ready to see where the show goes next.
