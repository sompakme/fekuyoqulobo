Iconic. Sorry not sorry, Eleanor Waldorf. However, becoming a successful new designer is no easy task. We mean, little J almost disowned her entire family for her fashion career.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Clothing Lines, Ranked</a></span></p><p>So what does it really take to become a new successful designer? The competition is unparalleled and the stakes are higher than you could ever imagine. In a sea full of potential only a few fishes will not get caught in another’s line. Keep scrolling to get the inside scoop on the 2020 prospects.</p><h2 id=usonia>USONIA</h2><p>Without even looking at any of their line, based on the name alone we want to buy whatever they are selling. The inspiration behind this lives up to their name. Pieces pay homage to Frank Lloyd Wright, American architect, interior designer, educator, and writer. Wright was known for his designs that embodied humanity and its environment. He referred to his philosophy as “organic architecture.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Behind it is new kid on the block Carmen Rivera and Dalia Stiller. Prior Rivera worked for Alexander Wang, and Stiller was an architect. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fun fact</a>: Stiller was Rivera’s mother’s college roommate. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USONIA</a> came about from an issue of Stiller’s. She wanted clothing that could take her from work to a romantic dinner. She then challenged Rivera to create such a thing. And here we have the birth of USONIA.</p><h2 id=puppets-and-puppets>Puppets and Puppets</h2><p>New York Fashion Week has transformed into a week full of new inventions and limitless creativity. One of the newest break-out designers is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Puppets and Puppets</a>. Who are they? Contemporary artist Carly Mark and her previous assistant Ayla Argentina have come together to create their own art.</p><p>Their newest collection was outrageous. One of the things they were inspired by was Fabergé eggs- yes, eggs. Picture this: shoes made from egg cartons paired with egg-yolk bralettes. Another inspiration for their second line was the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Psycho</a>. It was dauntingly beautiful.</p><h2 id=one-dna>One DNA</h2><p>We can all agree that the entire world is evolving. One of the greatest accomplishments to come out of this decade was the strides in universal equality. You can love who you want to love, and you can be who you were born to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gender-Neutral Birth Certificates Are Now Available In New Jersey</a></span></p><p>As for fashion: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One DNA</a> is a force in the unisex clothing world. They are the gender-neutral designer label. They say that “The designers break down the boundary between womenswear and menswear without sacrificing style.” We are here for it.</p><h2 id=16arlington>16Arlington</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">16Arlington</a> is a fashion line that has a modern-love story behind it. Based in London, a British couple living on Arlington Street had a fashion dream. Kikka Cavenati and Marco Capaldo’s dream came to life in 2017.</p><p>Since then they are quickly becoming one of London’s top luxury womenswear labels. So who’s the creative genius of the couple? Well, both of them actually. The duo says that they created the label to be a unification of both their styles; which is why it does so well. 16Arlington is the label that is high fashion mixed with London basics.</p><h2 id=nanushka>Nanushka</h2><p><a href=#>Nanushka</a> is significantly cooler than the average label. Designer Sandra Sandor, who was born and raised in Budapest, launched her own label a year after graduating college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Have you ever been to Budapest? We haven’t either, don’t worry. However, if you were to think of yourself traveling in Budapest, these are the clothes you’d be wearing. They are feminine and delicate. Sandor says, “The brand draws inspiration from the spiritual journey through cultures and time, effortlessly combining function with flair.” The clothing itself is designed in Budapest and manufactured in Europe; providing materials we’ve never seen elsewhere.</p><h2 id=linder>Linder</h2><p>We just have to start off by talking about Linder’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. It’s futuristic and old school all at once. You will want to buy everything they are selling just based off of the site alone. Now for the clothes: sorry ladies, its men’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clothing</a> only.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Simple Clothing Ideas That Made People Millionaires</a></span></p><p>As for the faces behind the brand; Sam Linder and Kirk Millar are two American country boys. However, their unique style is the complete opposite. Their New York City boutique is filled with untraditional yet highly fashionable pieces. Millar told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">W Magazine</a>, “We're tapping into weird places and have an excitement for the strange. Maybe a little darker; the unfamiliar.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=orseund-iris>Orseund Iris</h2><p><a href=#>New York</a> native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alana Johnson</a> is the face behind this post-college success story. How’d it happen? Like every good mother, Johnson’s told her to turn her dreams into reality. Millennial swag: Alana Johnson is no exception. She successfully marketed her designs through Instagram and now has over 300k followers.</p><p>It is only up from here from Johnson. Her clothing is simply cool; it’s the perfect mix of sweet, sexy, and stylish. Johnson’s inspiration is the New York City IT girls. In a short amount of time, she has made a name for her dresses, tops, and sweaters. Johnson calls her clothing “season-less.” Absolutely brilliant. Why wouldn’t you want to buy clothing that you can wear year-round in various different ways?</p><h2 id=j-r-me-lamaar>Jérôme LaMaar</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jérôme LaMaar</a> is the next big thing. He’s just got that undeniable swagger. LaMaar appropriately named himself the “style monk.” He also has got a pretty impressive past: at just age 15 he started his career in the fashion industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a teenager, LaMaar worked with Kimora Lee Simmons as not only a designer but as the creative director for both Baby Phat and Phat Farm brands. After that, he has worked with a plethora of impressive brands such as Swarovski, Tommy Hilfiger, Victoria’s Secret, Adidas and much more. His new line is a combination of his swag, street-style and art.</p><h2 id=ratio-et-motus>Ratio et Motus</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ratio et Motus</a> is the next celebrity “it” bag. To describe it in the best possible way: it looks like money. Their signature look resembles vintage Hermes paired with Princess Diana's regalness.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Iconic Designer Bags You Can Get For Less Than $1,000</a></span></p><p>It’s in the little details: a ball-clasp on the top. They come in a range of beautiful colors; however, our personal favorite is the classic white for $995. If you’re looking for a polished new bag for 2020, it’s their ivory “Twin Frame Bag,” for $1,495. The best part: you can channel your inner <a href=#>Lizzo</a> because it comes with the option to detach and were the mini-bag separately.</p><h2 id=moon-choi>Moon Choi</h2><p>A recent graduate of Parsons’, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Moon Choi</a> is about to make waves in the fashion scene. South Korean-born yet New York-based is not your average designer mashup. Nothing about Choi’s style is an imitation. She notes that her background is a huge influential factor in her clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Choi is going to be the designer that does this non-binary lifestyle justice. Her looks are both feminine and masculine. Pair that with exceptional tailor work and you’ve got yourself something incredible. Her silhouettes are so unique. She creates blazers that defy everything we’ve been subjected to. They are boxy with wide-shoulders yet maintain a tailored sleek sophistication. Go Choi go- we see Kendall Jenner rocking your suit; it’s your time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>10 Most Affordable Celebrity Clothing Lines</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKypobJwssCsn6KnnmKxpr%2FIoKWeqqNiwLXFy55kp52nYrGmr8CdnGZqYGd9cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
