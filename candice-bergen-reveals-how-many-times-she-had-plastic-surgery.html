The Oscar nominee and Murphy Brown star got candid about her weight and past plastic surgery while promoting her memoir, A Fine Romance, on the <a href=#>Today show</a> on Tuesday, April 7.</p><p><strong>Matt Lauer</strong> and Bergen, 68, breezed through several topics during their quick chat, with the Today co-host zeroing in on her body image comments that made the <a href=#>rounds in late March.</a> In an excerpt from her new book, Bergen wrote that she lives to eat and doesn’t care that she’s fat.</p><p>“It was a scant reference on page 150 or something. I was just saying, I don’t enjoy eating lunch with some women who only have kale,” Bergen clarified to Lauer, with a grin. “I just find it limiting. I’d rather not go on, if that’s what I have to eat to fuel myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I’m very comfortable,” she continued. “I mean, would I love to lose 10, 15 pounds? Absolutely. But I just haven’t taken the steps to do it.”</p><p>The Miss Congeniality star (much sweeter than her character Kathy Morningside!) also revealed the two times she went under the knife. “I had my eyes done at 41 when I started Murphy [Brown]. Then the following year I had some bands under my neck [done] because the light was catching them [on set]…and that’s all I’ve had done.”</p><p>Bergen is just as open about her professional life. In her memoir, she (of course!) talks about Murphy Brown, which ran from 1988 to 1998. One fun tidbit? After winning five Emmys for her role, she decided to take her name out of the running for a very sweet reason.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Every time I would get back to the set of Murphy [Brown] after winning an Emmy it would take about a week to get back to normal,” she explained to Lauer. “It was an ensemble cast and they all deserved Emmys [too]. I loved the cast and the crew.”</p><p>Watch the videos above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZ6ZtqSxjJucq5%2BVo3qzsdWemKWrXZ28uHnMmqWyZaSeuqa%2FjKyfnmWYlrFuvMuaqq2hk2LAtr7GnqmyZWJlfnaDk2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
