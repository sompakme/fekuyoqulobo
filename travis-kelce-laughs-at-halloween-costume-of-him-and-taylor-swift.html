Travis, 34, reacted to singer Jax’s hilarious “On the Map” costume, which referenced the phrase that took over social media as fans debated whether the Kansas City Chiefs player was as well-known as Swift. Jax’s fiancé, Braverijah Greg, dressed in a Swift, 33, costume — including a blonde wig — and then placed Swift’s face on Jax dressed as a map."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Jax’s fiancé, <strong>Braverijah Greg</strong>, dressed in a Swift, 33, costume — including a blonde wig — and then placed Swift’s face on Jax dressed as a map.</p><p>“Oh my f—king gosh. Oh my f—king goodness,” Travis laughed on a Wednesday, November 1, podcast episode of “<a href=# rel=noopener>New Heights</a>,” which he cohosts with brother <a href=#><strong>Jason Kelce</strong></a>, who cracked up in the background. “She put me on the map, right there in the video.”</p><p>“That’s so good, man,” Travis continued with a smile on his face. “God damn, that was golden. Hats off. That was well done. You get a round of applause for that one, I enjoyed that.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Travis — who is known for being one of the <a href=#>best players in the NFL</a> — has laughed at the phrase.</p><p>Earlier this month, a fan handed him <a href=#>a friendship bracelet</a> with “On the Map” spelled out on it during a Philadelphia Eagles vs. New York Jets game. At the time, he giggled and gave the fan a fist bump from afar.</p><p>Elsewhere in the podcast episode, Travis — who plays as a tight end for the Chiefs — declared this year “Kelce Halloween” while reacting to a family that dressed up as him, Jason <a href=#>and their mom</a>. In the photo, the mom rocked a split jersey featuring both of the athlete’s numbers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Travis-Kelce-Laughs-at-Fans-Dressing-Up-as-Him-and-Taylor-Swift-for-Halloween-That-Was-Golden.png><p>Another fan used an audio clip from “New Heights” while dressing up as the brothers. In the TikTok, the social media users mouthed over a conversation between Jason and Travis from when the Philadelphia Eagles player mentioned that wife <a href=#><strong>Kylie Kelce</strong> </a>was late to deliver his jeans.</p><p>Travis and Swift, 33, were first linked when he revealed he<a href=#> tried to ask her out</a> in July after attending <a href=#>an Eras Tour show</a> in Kansas City.</p><p>Swift later supported him at multiple Chiefs games in September and October and even sat beside his parents and brought famous friends including <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sabrina Carpenter</strong></a> and more.</p><p>On Monday, October 30, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that<a href=#> Swift flew to Kansas City</a> “to comfort and encourage [Travis] in any way she could” after the Chiefs lost to the Denver Broncos.</p><p>According to the insider, the duo was planning “to <a href=#>celebrate Halloween together</a>” by attending a few parties.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before Swift jets off to continue the second leg of her Eras Tour, a separate source told Us, “[Travis is] going to see her <a href=#>when she’s back on tour</a>. That’s already planned.” they continued, “And when she gets a break, she’ll see him. It’s going so well because it’s easy and nothing is complicated.”</p><p>Swift returns to tour on Thursday, November 9, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. She then travels to countries including Brazil, Japan, Australia, England, Germany and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1doa62s8esZJqsXZ2urbjOsJyepl2YvLTA1KacZqeWYrWquYyapZ1lpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
