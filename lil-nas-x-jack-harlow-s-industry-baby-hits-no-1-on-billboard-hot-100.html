Additionally, the song is also Kanye West's fifth No. 1 as a co-writer and co-producer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ariana Grande Brings Back Vinyl, Setting Another Billboard Record</a></span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, the track is so popular that it drew 23.2 million US streams and sold 34,300 downloads within the last week to hit the top spot on the list. The collaboration with Harlow is Lil Nas X's third Hot 100 leader, following the celebrated songs Old Town Road&nbsp;and Montero (Call Me by Your Name).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lil Nas X celebrated the news about the song being the number one song in the world in a tweet, with it navigating its way to the top of the list in a few months. Also noteworthy is that the coronation of Industry Baby&nbsp;marks the fifth on the Hot 100 for <a href=#>Kanye West</a> as a co-writer and co-producer.</p><p>The success of ‘Industry Baby’ is calculated from a congregation of data. The Hot 100 blends all-genre, including US streaming, sales data, and radio airplay. Released on July 23 by Columbia Records, Industry Baby&nbsp;is the 1,130th No. 1 in the Hot 100's 63-year history. It drew 64 million radio airplay audience impressions and sold 34,300 downloads and 23.2 million US streams by last week.</p><p>The hit song had embarked on a climb to the top since its debut. The catchy track rebounded from the second position to the top for a second week atop the Streaming Songs chart, vaulted from twelfth to number one for its first week atop Digital Song Sales, as it won top Sales Gainer honors on the Hot 100, and pushed to fourth from the fifth position on Radio Songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A clever sales tactic in the early weeks of October helped immensely. Two new versions of 'Industry Baby,' the first one with an alternative digital single cover and the second, an extended mix, were available for purchase from October 9, all discounted to 69 cents in the tracking week, which sparked its sales surge.</p><p>The music idol is no newbie to<a href=#> topping the Billboard</a>. Before the success of Industry Baby, the singer's debut smash and gender-bending opus 'Old Town Road' in collaboration with Billy Ray Cyrus, spent a record 19 weeks at No. 1 in 2019 and the wildly popular Montero (Call Me by Your Name)&nbsp;topped for a week upon its debut this April. Both Montero&nbsp;and Baby are from Lil Nas X's Montero, which soared to No. 2 on the October 2-dated <a href=#>Billboard 200.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With his latest achievement from the collaboration with Nas X, Harlow has crowned the Hot 100 for the first time, after hitting a previous No. 2 best in July 2020 with his breakthrough song 'Whats Poppin', which featured Lil Wayne, DaBaby, and Tory Lanez. Once touted as a one-hit-wonder, Lil Nas X is not afraid of revolutionizing the music industry and will undoubtedly deliver more blockbuster hits in the future.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Drake's 8 Most Impressive Guinness World Records</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5qriMp5isZahit6KvymafmqqcpMS0ecinm66rpKfGbq7Am7BmoJmpwG66zmZoZqeeYq%2BquMubppqqlGK1sMCMamdpZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
