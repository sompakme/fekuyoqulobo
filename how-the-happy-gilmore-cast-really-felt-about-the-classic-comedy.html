After he was unceremoniously fired from that legendary show, Sandler surprised many people when he began starring in one successful movie after another. Over the years, Sandler has headlined a long list of movies. When looking back at his career, it is widely agreed that <a href=#>some of Sandler’s movies are much better than others</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Saturday Night Live Cast Members Who Were Fired (And Why)</a></span></p><p>As anyone familiar with the internet should already know, virtually every topic can be heavily debated. For example, it is impossible to definitively say that one of Adam Sandler’s movies is better than all the rest. However, one thing is very clear, Happy Gilmore remains one of Sandler’s most popular films with fans. Despite that, most people have no idea how the stars of Happy Gilmore feel about the movie.</p><h2 id=adam-sandler-doesn-rsquo-t-talk-about-happy-gilmore-much>Adam Sandler Doesn’t Talk About Happy Gilmore Much</h2><p>When people think about the movie Happy Gilmore, there is one actor who comes to mind first and foremost, Adam Sandler. With that in mind, a lot of people may have assumed that Sandler talks about his feelings on Happy Gilmore all of the time. However, throughout Sandler’s time in the public eye, he has never been the kind of actor who waxes poetic about his films.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Adam Sandler Overpay To Have His Friends In His Films?</a></span></p><p>Instead of going on and on about the films he has starred in, Adam Sandler has always been more interested in talking about his pals during interviews. Given that <a href=#>Sandler always manages to find roles for his friends in his movies</a>, that isn’t overly surprising. Even though Sandler doesn’t really talk about Happy Gilmore, he has celebrated the movie’s legacy in his own way. After all, in 2021 Sandler recreated Happy Gilmore’s legendary golf swing on Twitter to celebrate the movie’s 25th anniversary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=happy-gilmore-rsquo-s-other-stars-seem-to-love-the-film>Happy Gilmore’s Other Stars Seem To Love The Film</h2><p>In an ideal world, every actor would only take roles in projects they believe in. Sadly, the reality of the situation is that actors often star in projects they don’t have faith in. For example, when Julie Bowen spoke to Yahoo! Entertainment in 2021, she admitted that she thought Happy Gilmore would flop. "I just thought, 'Oh, no one will ever see this." Despite her early misgivings, Bowen told People in 2021 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she loves how much people enjoy Happy Gilmore</a> and and then she went on to talk about how much fun it was to make.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Makes Fans Feel Nostalgic About ‘Happy Gilmore’ 25 Years Later</a></span></p><p>"I cherish and I love that it has become this weird, internationally beloved thing. Doing an Adam movie isn't pressure, it's fun and it's like going home. He puts everybody's comfort and ease first and foremost, and wants everybody to be happy to be there. There's no stress, no yelling and screaming, it's just a really pleasant place to be."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Bob Barker only appeared in Happy Gilmore briefly, the film has become a major part of his legacy. With that in mind, it makes sense that when he spoke to People in 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barker seemed to delight in the fact that he often gets asked about Happy Gilmore</a>. "I never taped a Price Is Right after the movie release that the audience didn't want to, during commercials, talk about Happy Gilmore. They loved it. They asked me all sorts of things.”</p><p>Just like Bob Barker, Carl Weathers already was a legend when he agreed to star in Happy Gilmore. Despite his superstar status, Weathers clearly doesn’t look down on his Happy Gilmore experience based on what he had to say during a 2017 appearance on The Rich Eisen Show. After all, when Weathers was asked about Happy Gilmore’s script, he remarked “I loved it, man.” After talking about meeting with Adam Sandler and getting cast in Happy Gilmore, Weathers also went on talk about how much fun he had making the movie. “I was in the movie and had one of the best times ever.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Oscar Winner Nearly Played Shooter McGavin In 'Happy Gilmore'</a></span></p><p>Even though everyone who starred in Happy Gilmore seems happy to be a part of it, the actor who played the movie’s villain Shooter McGavin appears to love talking about it the most. For example, Christopher McDonald often talks about starring in Happy Gilmore during interviews including when he made an appearance on NBC Sports in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It’s different now because I’m wearing a mask, but when I don’t have my mask on and I’m walking around I hear people saying ‘Shooter!’ all the time - it’s incredible. It’s generational now, kids watch it with their grandparents," Chrsitopher said before adding, "This movie has legs because it’s funny, really funny. It comes on television - that’s why it exploded, because it would come on television and people had to watch it because it was funny. Kudos to Adam Sandler and Tim Herlihy, who wrote it, Judd Apatow, and the great cast. It goes on and on and on, and I’m just so glad to be part of it.”</p><p>Still not through singing Happy Gilmore’s praises, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher McDonald told NBC Sports that starring in the movie is a career highlight for him</a>. “My Dad told me that as an actor you get five really great roles in your career. Some people get a lot more but if you have five you’re a success, and this is in my top five. It’s a great movie that makes people feel good.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Adam Sandler Is All For A 'Happy Gilmore' Sequel</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FArKtmp5ZitaK8z7JkoKGcoryzsYyrnJqbpJ68r3mRaWlrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
