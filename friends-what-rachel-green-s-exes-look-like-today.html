While most of these relationships ended in breakups, she maintained an on-and-off relationship with Monica’s brother, Ross. Despite the pain and laughter, Green’s exes caused her, the actors who portrayed them were the best thing about the show. The show would cast sexy actors like Ben Stiller and Delmort Mulroney to play Rachel’s love interests.
