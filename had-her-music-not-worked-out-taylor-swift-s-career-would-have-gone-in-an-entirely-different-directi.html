While, thankfully for the world, she didn't have to go down this other route, it was one she had considered as a little girl and is miles away from the life she lives now.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-has-had-an-impressive-career>Taylor Swift Has Had An Impressive Career</h2><p>With a career spanning almost two decades, it's safe to say that there's not much Taylor hasn't achieved in her career. In fact, in 2020, she was <a href=#>named the world's best solo act at the NMEs</a> and sold the most singles between 2010 and 2020. Considering that was in the first half of her career so far, she's doing pretty well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was also able to <a href=#>beat Michael Jackson's record of having the most AMA awards</a>. He managed to get to twenty-four, but at the time that Taylor beat his record, she had won twenty-eight and since then has managed to get that up to an impressive forty awards.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Taylor Swift's Music Made The Summer I Turned Pretty A Much Better Show</a></span></p><p>Having also been able to <a href=#>win multiple Grammy Awards</a> throughout her career, it's hard to imagine her doing anything else.</p><h2 id=what-career-would-taylor-swift-be-doing-if-music-didn-39-t-work-out>What Career Would Taylor Swift Be Doing If Music Didn't Work Out?</h2><p>As has been more than documented, Taylor has had major success as a singer-songwriter and doesn't appear to be considering leaving the music industry anytime soon. In 2023, she set out on <a href=#>The Eras Tour world tour</a> with another older album (Speak Now) set to re-release in July 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Where she started from quite a young age with this career and appeared to have achieved success with it from quite early on, it's hard to imagine Taylor doing anything else. However, there was one career she could have gone into if her early childhood years are anything to go by.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-looking-surprised.jpg><p>Like many children, Taylor was heavily influenced by the work that her parents did. She looked at the work that they were doing and quite possibly, like many other children out there, saw that work as something that she would one day go on to do in the future.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Taylor Swift's Parents Care About Who She's Dating? Here's Everything They've Said About Her Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview on YouTube</a>, Taylor revealed that on her very first day of school, she and her classmates were being asked the age-old question, "what do you want to be when you grow up?". She said that a lot of the children were coming up with quite standard child-like responses, such as an astronaut or ballerina, but that her response certainly stood her out from everyone else.</p><p>Taylor's dad is a financial planner, and naturally, she wanted to take after her dad, so she announced to her entire class and teacher that she wanted to become a financial advisor. Certainly not the type of thing fans imagine an eight-year-old to say or something they imagine someone like Taylor Swift does, but it's still quite sweet that she wanted to take after her dad.</p><p>Of course, she's unlikely to need to change careers anytime soon as she has a <a href=#>net worth of over $400 million</a> and an army of fans, her 'Swifties', that is constantly behind her and support her in whatever she does.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-39-s-father-buy-a-record-label>Did Taylor Swift's Father Buy A Record Label?</h2><p>With a daughter in the music industry and being a successful financial planner, it's highly unlikely that Taylor's dad wouldn't know the best places to invest his money into. Especially as the music industry is said to be worth quite a lot of money, this is probably one of the best places to put it.</p><p>Even though he didn't actually buy a record label, he did invest in one. Fans of Taylor will know that when she was first starting out in the industry, she was signed to the record label Big Machine Records.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></span></p><p>Whether the reason was that he saw the potential in his daughter (he did move his entire family and career over to Nashville for her to start her career), or if it was because he saw the potential in the company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor's father invested a massive $300,000 for a 3% stake</a>, all while she was still recording her debut album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=did-taylor-swift-39-s-dad-buy-her-career>Did Taylor Swift's Dad Buy Her Career?</h3><p>Due to her dad buying a stake in her old record company at the beginning of her career, there have been many questions about whether her dad actually bought Taylor her career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/taylor-swift-2.jpg><p>Despite owning 3% of Big Machine Records, Taylor's dad did not buy her career. He only had a very small stake in the company and there is no denying that she is an incredibly talented musician, which is something that cannot be brought.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmJaxbq2MnaCfnpWnsq%2FAjJyYq52Vp3qqsMSaZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
