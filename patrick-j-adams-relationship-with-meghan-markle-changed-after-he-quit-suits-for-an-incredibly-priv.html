"After our children were born, there were some texts sent and gifts sent, but I guess I'm a little scared. I think it's pure fear. I guess I'm scared about the idea of breaking through whatever walls exist to have that conversation."</p><p>He further explained, "Quite frankly, I think I'm intimidated.
