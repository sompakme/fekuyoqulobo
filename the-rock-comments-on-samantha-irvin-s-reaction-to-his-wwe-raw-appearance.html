As he was talking trash, out came the King of Trash Talking, <a href=#>The People’s Champion, The Rock</a>. He verbally assaulted the Modern Day Maharaja and then hit a spinebuster, followed by the most electrifying move in all of Sports Entertainment, The People’s Elbow.</p><p>Following that, The Rock also <a href=#>hinted at whom he wants to wrestle next</a>. It was none other than the Head of the Table, <a href=#>Roman Reigns</a>.</p><p>WWE posted a video on social media of how ring announcer <a href=#>Samantha Irvin</a> reacted when The People’s Champion’s theme song began playing. Upon seeing the video, The Rock replied to the clip saying that he loved seeing Samantha Irwin’s reaction and also praised her by claiming that she is dope.</p><p>“Love this. She’s dope. @SamanthaTheBomb @WWE,” The Rock said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Great One also posted on Instagram a clip involving the highlights of his return to Monday night Raw.

The theme, the crowd, the connection, the reaction, the electricity, the chills-the mana. Helluva way to bring in 2024.
