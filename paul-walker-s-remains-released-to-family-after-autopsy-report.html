An autopsy completed earlier this month indicated that the cause of death was a combination of "traumatic and thermal injuries" from both the impact of the accident and the resulting fire.</p><p>The actor's friend <strong>Roger Rodas</strong> — believed to be the driver — was also killed in the crash; he died upon impact. Both deaths were ruled an accident by the medical examiner. <a href=#>See more stars we lost in 2013</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Walker is survived by a 15-year-old daughter, <strong>Meadow</strong>; his father, <strong>Paul Walker III</strong>; his mother, <strong>Cheryl Walker</strong>; and his siblings.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaWherity6Scq6tdp7KurcinqmaqlaGyor%2FEnWStp12brq61y7Jkmp6kmr9urdStpqmrqWK%2FprzOq6tmamBmgHJ8kGtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
