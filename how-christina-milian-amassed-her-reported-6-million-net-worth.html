In fact, there was so much hype around her at the time that many even believed she could quite possibly become one of the biggest R&B singers in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while Christina did go on to receive plenty of more chart success with her 2004 follow-up album, It’s About Time, which spawned the smash hit “Dip It Low,” by the time she would go on to release her third record, So Amazin’, in 2006, she had been shelved by her record label Island Def Jam to prioritize their budget on other artists such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a>.</p><p>Still, while she hasn’t released an album in 15 years, Christina, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who's a spokeswoman for RiRi's Savage X Fenty</a>, has kept herself busy elsewhere, including the big screen, having starred in a string of blockbuster flicks and a handful of reality shows — so how exactly did she amass her $6 million fortune? Let’s find out.</p><h2 id=christina-milian-s-net-worth>Christina Milian’s Net Worth</h2><p>Most of Christina’s earnings stem from her music career, after having inked a deal with Murder Inc. and Island Def Jam, who would distribute her first album in 2001.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The record spawned two singles, “AM to PM,” and “When You Look At Me,” which both performed exceptionally well on the UK chart, where they both earned respective spots in the Top 5.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicki Minaj’s Closest Hollywood Friends (& 5 Bridges She Burned)</a></span></p><p>Seeing that her first offering was released two weeks after the NYC terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, she decided to mark what would’ve been her second album as her first in the U.S. with It’s About Time, which was released in June 2004.</p><p>The album included Christina’s biggest song to date, "Dip It Low," which went on to sell over two million copies worldwide and peak at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>She released her second and last single from the project with “Whatever U Want” featuring Joe Budden, and while the track entered the Top 10 in the UK, it barely managed to crack the Top 100 in the U.S., which appeared to worry Island Def Jam, who had invested quite a lot of money in marketing and promoting Christina’s music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mother of two would release her third and final album, So Amazin’, in 2006, which only included one single, “Say I,” before parting ways with her record label, who she believed had made her career less of a priority to continue developing other artists who had shown greater success, including Rihanna.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Amazing Things Rihanna Has Done For The World</a></span></p><p>By 2006, the latter already had two successful albums under her belt, 2005’s Music of the Sun (which sold two million worldwide) and A Girl Like Me (another four million units), and given that Christina wasn’t generating enough profit for her label, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they ultimately decided to cut ties with her</a>.</p><p>In a 2008 interview with Rap-Up Magazine, she expressed, “It was a budget cut, I believe. [Def Jam] probably got rid of projects like mine to spend the money on [Rihanna].”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She went on to describe the record label’s decision as one of the most embarrassing moments in her life, leading her to shy away from the public and spend weeks crying about the ordeal in her bedroom.</p><p>But Christina was adamant that getting dropped from Island Def Jam wasn’t going to be the end for her.</p><p>She turned her attention to the big screen, where she landed roles in movies such as Pulse, before signing on for a string of TV movies including Eight Days a Week, Snowglobe, and Christmas Cupid.</p><p>In 2013, she starred opposite Paula Patton, Taye Diggs, and Jill Scott in the ever-so-popular motion picture Baggage Claim, and in 2015, Christina signed on for a recurring role in the TV series East Los High, where she played Liliana for six episodes.</p><p>Other television shows she’s appeared in include Grandfathered, The Oath, and Family Guy.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Fans Think Rihanna Doesn’t Get Along With Rita Ora</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 39-year-old also had a lengthy run on reality television, appearing on shows such as Dancing With the Stars, The Voice (where she acted as a social media correspondent), along with her very own show on E! titled Christina Million Turned Up.</p><p>The latter project spanned two seasons before it was canceled by the network.</p><p>Christina says that while she hasn’t dropped an album since 2006, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she’s determined to put out a new record</a> in the near future, though she still doesn’t know whether signing to a record deal would be the wisest decision.</p><p>If she was to release another album, it’ll most likely be done independently.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown Fans Joke He’s Somewhere ‘Moonwalking’ After Karrueche’s ‘Love Split’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmLWztdKtoKeZXaK2rbXAp2SapZGowKawjKGcq2Wimr2wvtOem2ZuXaK2rbjIqKVmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
