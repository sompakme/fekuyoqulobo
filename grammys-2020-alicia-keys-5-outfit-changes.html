And it’s safe to say that the singer nearly stole the show thanks to outfit changes that were just as exciting as the celeb-studded red carpet.
Over the course of the “10,000 hours-long” ceremony (hey, Keys said it first), the singer changed ensembles a total of five times. She opened the show wearing a silver sequined Versace one-shoulder gown and ended it in a black jumpsuit with what looks like bedazzled boob tape and colorful over-the-knee Versace boots."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She opened the show wearing a silver sequined Versace one-shoulder gown and ended it in a black jumpsuit with what looks like bedazzled boob tape and colorful over-the-knee Versace boots.</p><p>In between, fashion stylist Jason Bolden helped Keys choose a variety of statement-making ‘fits, one of our favorites being a silver sequined denim-on-denim outfit worth using as street style inspo. Underneath the jean jacket, she wore a camel-colored crop top and for shoes, she went for high platform boots.</p><p>Another one of the night’s iconic looks was a bright pink pantsuit, featuring a cropped blazer and wide-leg pants, which she styled with sparkly silver heels.</p><p>Keys looked amazing, but that’s not to say that it wasn’t a difficult evening for her following the tragic passing of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Kobe Bryant</strong></a> and his 13-year-old daughter, <strong>Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant</strong> earlier in the day. Wearing the aforementioned Versace gown, Keys sang a tribute to all of the victims of the accident with <strong>Boyz II Men</strong> at the start of the ceremony.</p><p>“Tonight was tough but we made it through,” said Keys in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a> after the show. “Tonight felt like a roller coaster and we were connected through it all. I felt your energy tonight like no other 💜💜. I can’t even express how I feel right now. So much love. Let’s hold each other close. Life is too short and unexpected.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued, “Kobe and Gianna lifted us up tonight. Strength, support, love and blessings to the Bryant family 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 And to all the amazing artists sharing your soul tonight and always. It is an honor to stand with you. You are respected and loved. Forever yours AK.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all of the outfits Keys wore during the 62nd annual Grammy awards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvGq5impamoenN8kWlkmqSZmLaiecqesKxlZWK8tsDFoqtmm5iWu6ix0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
