UFC President Dana White acknowledged that Cormier vs. Lesnar was the next fight he wanted to make, however, several months later, negotiations fell through, and Lesnar opted to remain with WWE.</p><p>It’s believed the UFC’s new pay-per-view (PPV) model was to blame for the failed negotiations between Lesnar and the Las Vegas-based promotion. Cormier himself believes as much, as he told ESPN’s Marc Raimondi. “DC” believes Lesnar made the decision to take guaranteed money in the WWE and remain with the professional wrestling juggernaut, where he wouldn’t have to work as hard as he would in the UFC.</p><p>Check out his comments in the Tweet below:</p><p>I think when Brock looked at the landscape of the sport, what they were offering him, Brock said, ‘I can make guaranteed money [in WWE].’ Not work as hard. He’d have to work his ass off [to fight me] and it’s probably gonna go the bad way. Whereas with the WWE, it’s usually determined in his favor. So, as a businessman, I think Brock made the right decision.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I asked <a href=#>@dc_mma</a> about how he felt when he saw Brock Lesnar return to WWE earlier this month, choosing that over fighting Cormier this summer. Here's what DC said: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bJbRB0wzu0</a></p><p>— Marc Raimondi (@marcraimondi) <a href=#>May 30, 2019</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfY9ybm9oaWKxorrInqNmm5%2Bnuqqx0WaZq6eToHqtsdKnmKtlk528tLGMsK6eZZ%2BrsrN51J%2Ba</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
