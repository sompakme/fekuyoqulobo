There were rumors circulating that he had even rekindled his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">alleged romance with singer Demi Lovato</a>, who was said to have been blindsided by Jonas’ move to not only get with Chopra but also marry her.</p><p>The 29-year-old presented his leading lady with a stunning engagement ring, but how much did the pricey piece of jewelry end up costing Jonas? Here’s the lowdown…</p><h2 id=how-much-was-priyanka-chopra-rsquo-s-wedding-ring-worth>How Much Was Priyanka Chopra’s Wedding Ring Worth?</h2><p>Fans were all kinds of confused when Jonas opted not to invite Lovato to his wedding in December 2018 — but if we are to believe what some have said on social media, it actually makes perfect sense why she wasn’t there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s rumored that the Sorry Not Sorry hitmaker was at one point dating Jonas, who she took on the road with her for the Future Now tour in 2016. With three legs and 47 shows, the pair pulled in a whopping $17.5 million at the box office, with their first gig held at the Phillips Arena in Atlanta in June 2016 and their final concert in Monterrey in October 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priyanka Chopra Trolls Husband Nick Jonas's Acting Skills During The ‘Jonas Brothers Family Roast’</a></span></p><p>During this time, fans had speculated whether the two were more than just close friends.</p><p>It’s long been said that Lovato’s songs “Ruin The Friendship” and “Only Forever,” two songs lifted from her 2017 album Tell Me You Love, were written with Jonas in mind, with whom she supposedly shared an on-again, off-again romance with for several years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After ending things with Culpo in 2015, some believe Jonas and Lovato were seeing each other on and off; they just never went public with their relationship.</p><p>It was later revealed that Lovato had also recorded a song for the album that didn’t end up making the cut, titled Ain’t No Friend, which, according to Perez Hilton, ended up leaking — and the lyrics <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">are pretty obvious who she’s singing about</a>.</p><p>“This ain't no safe house / Saw my ship, and it wrecked, now you wanna dip out,” she sings. “It was all good back when we were working for the big mouse. We were best friends, family, and everything between. Never thought you'd be the enemy, no.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Jonas Replaces Shaquille O'Neal In Upcoming Competition Series</a></span></p><p>Despite their history, it seemed Lovato was still cool with Jonas up until her infamous overdose over the summer of 2018. When the Sonny With A Chance went to rehab a few months later, she and Jonas both unfollowed each other on Instagram, which was a telling sign there were problems in their friendship.</p><p>But according to Us Weekly, Lovato was “upset” that Jonas did not issue her an invite to his wedding, given all the history between them.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas-spent-six-figures-on-priyanka-rsquo-s-ring>Nick Jonas Spent Six-Figures On Priyanka’s Ring</h2><p>Jonas reportedly spent between $200k to $300k on the stunning diamond-encrusted wedding ring he presented Chopra.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The piece of jewelry was bought at Tiffany’s — but in a desperate attempt not to be photographed purchasing the ring for his now-wife, Jonas is said to have shut the store down so that he wouldn’t have to worry about his big surprise being spoiled.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Jonas And Priyanka Chopra Baby Gender Revealed After Welcoming First Child</a></span></p><p>Speaking to People, it seemed as if Chopra had always been a huge fan of Tiffanys’, having expressed to the publication: "I just knew it since I was a kid. First, it was Breakfast at Tiffany's that did it for every girl in the world and then, of course, Sweet Home Alabama came and put a stamp on it that it has to be Tiffany!”</p><p>In January 2022, the pair announced they had welcomed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their first child together via a surrogate</a> in identical Instagram posts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We are overjoyed to confirm that we have welcomed a baby via surrogate,” they wrote. “We respectfully ask for privacy during this special time as we focus on our family.
