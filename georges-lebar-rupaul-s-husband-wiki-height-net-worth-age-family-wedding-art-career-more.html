RuPaul met his husband, Georges LeBar, at a New York City nightclub in the early 1990s. In 2017, the drag queen gushed to Hollywood Today ‘I met him on the dancefloor at Limelight in 1994 on his birthday’. RuPaul also added that he and his longtime partner secretly tied the knot in January on their 23rd anniversary.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Georges-LeBar-is-well-known-as-RuPauls-husband.jpg><p>The couple has been together ever since, although they only just married on the anniversary of the meeting in 2017.

He’s also a professional painter, describing his work on his website as a ‘reference from my history and comparing it to the present; art is about exploring life for me.’ While his husband succeeds in show business, Georges prefers life out of the limelight. He spends his time tending to his ranch in Wyoming, US, which is reportedly over 60k acres.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wikicelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Georges-LeBar-is-a-rancher-author-and-painter.jpg><p>The media outlets said he inherited the LeBar Ranch from his grandfather, who led a thriving sheep and cattle operation for decades. There are stories that oil companies may be fracking on the 60k acres ranch, but neither Georges nor RuPaul has publicly commented on the accusations. However, their neighbors came ahead and stated the duo probably doesn’t have a say over whether fracking happens on their property.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Favorites></span><strong>Favorites</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Actor</strong></td><td>Hugh Jackman</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pet</strong></td><td>Dog and Cat</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Food</strong></td><td>Fajitas and Jerky</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Destination</strong></td><td>Miami, Paris, and New York</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Color</strong></td><td>Black, brown, and white</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hobbies</strong></td><td>Reading books, painting, writing, listening to music, and traveling</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Georges_LeBars_Net_Worth></span><strong>Georges LeBar’s Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Georges is an author, novelist, rancher, and professional painter who mostly earns from his ranch.
