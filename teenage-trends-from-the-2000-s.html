It’s a weird transition where you think you’re an adult, but you’re really not, and you think you know it all, but you really don’t. Your body is changing and no one gets it except <a title="Avril Lavigne Net Worth" href=#>Avril Lavigne</a>. So the only rational thing to do would be for teenagers to make it even more difficult for each other to survive this period with fashion trends. Woe to the kid who can’t convince her parents to buy her $300 boots lined with real sheep's wool. Growing up as a teen in the 2000’s was no exception.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tna-yoga-pants><strong>TNA/Yoga Pants</strong></h2><p>Our parents worst nightmare. See through, skin tight pants that are widely accepted as appropriate clothing options in present society.</p><h2 id=uggs><strong>Uggs</strong></h2><p>No TNA pant was complete without ending in these furry trends. The best trend is a functional one, and these boots were functional! Fuzzy warm perfection. Just don't walk through melting snow on your way to school or your day will be miserable.</p><h2 id=heavy-eyeliner><strong>Heavy Eyeliner</strong></h2><p>The face of misunderstood teenage girls everywhere back in the day. Although in retrospect we looked like a raccoon, but at that time it looked good. Right?</p><h2 id=du-rags><strong>DU-Rags</strong></h2><p>These are meant to be worn to bed! I blame hip hop entirely for the prevalence of this&nbsp;short lived fashion fiasco.</p><h2 id=night-clothes-in-the-day-time><strong>Night Clothes In the Day Time</strong></h2><p>No blaming hip hop for this daytime disaster. I can't quite remember if it was just that we did not change our clothes when we woke up or if we did not change our clothes to go to bed. Either way, gross.</p><h2 id=the-hair-poof><strong>The Hair Poof</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I don't care who you are, if you were in high school when this trend gained popularity, you took a hair-clip and the hair directly above your forehead, and made a poof. Don't even try to deny it. The only positive thing that came out of&nbsp;The Jersey Shore&nbsp;was the death of this trend.</p><h2 id=lace-trim-tops><strong>Lace Trim Tops</strong></h2><p>Camisoles, tank tops, t-shirts, long sleeves, regardless of what you wore, the upper portion of your body had to end with lace. And we layered them!</p><h2 id=chinese-slippers><strong>Chinese Slippers</strong></h2><p>Thank goodness for Chinese Slippers! Any local dollar store carried these, making it one of the most affordable trends. Remember the tan you got from these bad boys? Not cute.</p><h2 id=huge-purses><strong>Huge Purses</strong></h2><p>I'm not quite sure if maybe we just had more stuff last decade, but our bags were huge. And they were full.</p><h2 id=kappa-tear-away-pants><strong>Kappa 'Tear Away' Pants</strong></h2><p>Many brands of the 'tear away' pant surfaced during this craze of easily removable clothing. However, the Kappa brand reigned supreme. Thousands of welcomed clothing malfunctions occurred in schools across the globe as a result of these easily unbuttoned track pants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=toddler-tv-apparel><strong>Toddler TV Apparel</strong></h2><p>Teenagers wearing the paraphernalia of their smaller siblings favorite TV shows... How else could you name this trend? Dora backpacks in high school? Not cute.</p><h2 id=velour-track-suits><strong>Velour Track Suits</strong></h2><p>I think that the yoga pant replaced this trend, but who doesn't love looking hot, feeling silky smooth and warm all at the same time. I sense a comeback.</p><h2 id=plastic-colorful-bracelets><strong>Plastic Colorful Bracelets</strong></h2><p>These bracelets had a different meaning then just being an accessory, and anyone who grew up in this millennium will know what they were for.</p><h2 id=checkered-laces><strong>Checkered Laces</strong></h2><p>Behold, pure art. We were a creative and talented bunch, what happened... The ability to checker laces was a skill that was revered on the playground. The most talented were paid for there services in Vanilla Sparkle Dunkaroo's and Marble Cheese Strings.</p><h2 id=over-sized-denim><b>Over-sized</b><strong>&nbsp;Denim</strong></h2><p>The bigger the denim, the bigger the ego. All the hot guys in high school wore pants that were 5 sizes too big, and we loved every extra inch of unnecessary fabric. Thank God for Fubu and Rocawear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=axe-body-spray><strong>Axe Body Spray</strong></h2><p>A scent allergist's worst nightmare. Where in the instructions for this product did it advise its wearers to empty the majority of its contents in school hallways. Did guys think it was an air freshener, because in my opinion it was more of a pollutant. Also, not cute.&nbsp;Axe: the unofficial scent of the 2000's.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3y1scSnmKCdXam%2FprrDrGSfqp%2BierW0xGZpaWhgqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
