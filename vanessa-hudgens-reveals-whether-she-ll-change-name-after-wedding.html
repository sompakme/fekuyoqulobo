Let’s do it, but, like, really do it. So, I sent them photos of, like, chic funeral wear.”</p><p>The <a href=#>High School Musical</a> star wore a white gown during one of the group’s nights out in Aspen, Colorado, while her crew dressed in all black.</p><p>Despite the dark and deadly vibe, Hudgens said the getaway was “great” and “very magical.” In fact, she called the weekend “really grown” because of the relaxed itinerary. “It was a zen hen,” she said with a laugh. “We did yoga. We did sound baths. We went hiking. It was like a health retreat.”</p><p>Following her girls’ trip, Hudgens reunited with her partner to celebrate her favorite night of the year: <a href=#>Halloween</a>.</p><p>“He’s just not, like, a seasonal person,” Hudgens explained of Tucker, 27. “He didn’t grow up super celebrating the holidays. I definitely come up with costumes for us, and I get it, and I’m like, ‘Here you go babe!’ And he throws it on and he’s down to do it.”</p><p>This year, the couple dressed as Zorro and Elena from 1998’s <a href=# rel=noopener>The Mask of Zorro</a>. They later embodied rockers <a href=#><strong>Slash</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Axl Rose</strong></a> of Guns N’ Roses for <a href=# rel=noopener>a separate holiday bash</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hudgens and Tucker <a href=#>were first linked in fall 2020</a> but didn’t make their relationship Instagram official until February 2021. Us Weekly confirmed in February that <a href=#>the Pittsburgh Pirates player proposed in late 2022</a>.</p><p>One week later, Hudgens shared a photo of her engagement ring with the Eiffel Tower in the background. “YES. We couldn’t be happier!” she captioned the snap.</p><p>Hudgens opened up about the milestone <a href=#>during an April appearance on the Today show</a>. “It feels amazing,” she gushed. “It’s so funny, I was talking about this with Cole. People are always like, ‘Does it feel different? [Do] things feel different [getting engaged]?’ That was always my question normally, but now I get to be asked it. And you know what, it actually does. There’s a sense of security. You feel so safe. It’s the best thing ever. I love being a fiancée.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6awLStjKGsnZ%2BVo8BuvsSvnJqko2LEqbHToZyrZaOdsq24jJyfmqaXmnqvrcyeZJqepJq%2FbsPEnZuippdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
