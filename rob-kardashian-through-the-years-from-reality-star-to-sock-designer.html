He later used his celebrity status to land in second place on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>’ 13th season in 2011. That following year, he launched a designer sock label called Arthur George.</p><p>Rob eventually got <a href=#>his own KUWTK spinoff</a> in 2016 titled Rob & Chyna, which he costarred on alongside his then-fiancée, <a href=#><strong>Blac Chyna</strong></a>. The series only lasted for one season on E!</p><p>Outside of entertainment, the reality star earned a college degree in 2009 from the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business. He also became a loving father to <a href=#>his daughter, Dream</a>, whom he shares with Chyna.</p><p>Despite his accomplishments, Rob <a href=#>has also faced some major hardships</a> in the public eye. The California native has long struggled with his health, including being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2015. The same year of his diagnosis, he was hospitalized for failing to take his insulin. He then said he was diabetes-free in 2016.</p><p>Rob has also <a href=#>struggled with his weight</a> over the years, leading him to avoid the spotlight and make infrequent appearances on his family’s TV show. The businessman, however, made major strides in recent years by committing to getting back in shape. In June 2020, he made headlines after debuting his dramatic <a href=# data-link=1>weight loss</a> at sister <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>’s 36th birthday party.</p><p>Additionally, Rob faced legal trouble at the start of 2020 through a messy custody battle with Chyna. He <a href=#>filed a motion to obtain primary custody</a> of the exes’ daughter. When the petition was denied, <a href=#>he filed another request</a> with specific measures about visitation and custody of Dream. The former couple also <a href=#>made a series of allegations against each other</a>, which they both subsequently denied.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>An insider told Us Weekly in August 2020 that Rob, who has also been linked to <a href=#><strong>Adrienne Bailon</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Rita Ora</strong></a>, <a href=#>had been “casually dating.”</a> At the time, he was <a href=#>most recently associated with model <strong>Aileen Gisselle</strong></a>.</p><p>Scroll down to check out photos of Rob through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkv7CujKSYq5yRqLWqrc1mq6Gqn6q0qXnToZxmsZWWv7R5xaumpmWimq6ttdOyZKyskad6tbuMrKaco12ZsrS1xqecq2WnZoN1fJRvZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
