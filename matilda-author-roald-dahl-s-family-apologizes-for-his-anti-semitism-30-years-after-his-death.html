In 1983, Dahl told Britain’s New Statesman that Jewish people had a character flaw the provoked hostility in others.</p><p>“There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it’s a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews. I mean there is always a reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn’t just pick on them for no reason,” he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The author doubled down on his statement in an interview in The Guardian in 1990, the year he died. “I’m certainly anti-Israeli and I’ve become antisemitic in as much as that you get a Jewish person in another country like England strongly supporting Zionism. We all know about Jews and the rest of it. There aren’t any non-Jewish publishers anywhere, they control the media.”</p><p>In recent years, many have questioned the meaning behind his stories as a result of those statements. A number of Jewish advocacy groups said the apology was long overdue and lamented that it was limited to a single statement buried on his website. The Board of Deputies of British Jews stated, “This apology should have happened long ago - and it is of concern that it has happened so quietly now. Roald Dahl’s abhorrent antisemitic prejudices were no secret and have tarnished his legacy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Campaign Against Antisemitism said, “The admission that the famous author’s antisemitic views are ‘incomprehensible’ is right. For his family and estate to have waited thirty years to make an apology, apparently until lucrative deals were signed with Hollywood, is disappointing and sadly rather more comprehensible.”</p><p>In 2018, The Hollywood Reporter <a href=#>revealed that Netflix</a> had reportedly paid $1 billion for the rights to Dahl’s stories.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>FoxNews</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Nick Cannon Issues Apology For Anti-Semitic Comments After Being Fired By CBS" href=#>Nick Cannon Issues Apology For Anti-Semitic Comments After Being Fired By CBS</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiqn5a5pXnDmp%2Blq12brq61y7Jkmqifobyotdmeqmaen6d6ra3TnmSaraSdvLO%2FjJqlraFdqLKutdOiqqZn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
