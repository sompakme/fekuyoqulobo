Biles’ former <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> partner, <a href=#><strong>Sasha Farber</strong></a>, added, “Omggggggggg congratulations.”</p><p>The Ohio native and the football player <a href=#>confirmed their relationship</a> in August 2020 after sparking dating speculation weeks prior. When it was time to celebrate their first anniversary in 2021, Biles was competing in the Tokyo Olympics. While her experience at the summer tournament <a href=#>didn’t go as planned</a> due to a bout of the “twisties” and a <a href=#>tough mental health battle</a>, Owens was still his then-girlfriend’s No. 1 fan.</p><p>“Imma ride with you through whatever baby ❤️,” he gushed via Instagram in July 2021 <a href=#>after Biles withdrew</a> from the competition. “Your strength and courage is unmatched and you inspire me more and more everyday SB 🤞🏽You always gone be my champ baby and don’t you ever forget that, I love you so much and I can’t wait till you come home and I get to see that beautiful smile again. You know I’m always here for you baby ❤️❤️.”</p><p>The Flying High author has been equally as supportive of Owens throughout <a href=#>his NFL career</a>, cheering him on after he made a <a href=#>game-changing interception</a> against the Los Angeles Chargers in December 2021. “LFG!!!!!!! #36,” she tweeted at the time alongside a clip of the major play.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this year,<a href=#> Biles reflected on her first encounter</a> with the Missouri native, which took place months before their romance began.</p><p>“Okay how CRAZY is this photo. December 2019. Texans had me for homefield advantage & I lead the team out of the tunnel… but look whose behind me …… @jowens_3,” she captioned a throwback photo via her Instagram Story in January, drawing an arrow to Owens in the background of the shot. “God works in mysterious ways!”</p><p>Scroll down to see more of the pair’s romantic proposal:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwKq5zqecZpqZobK0ecGosJ%2BqmZq7pXnJqKWarJiWu2671p6lrGWVo7Sis8SdZJ2dpJa2rb%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
