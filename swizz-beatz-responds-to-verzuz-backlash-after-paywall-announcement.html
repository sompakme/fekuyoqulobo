However, initial skepticism over Verzuz‘s partnership with Triller and how it will impact the future of the platform has reared its head again following reports that fans would have to pay to watch the forthcoming Verzuz battle, creating an uproar amongst longtime supporters of the series."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

DON’T WAIT!!)) LINK IN BIO!!!” read the first post, which included a comment stating “THIS VERZUZ WILL NOT BE ON IG.”</p><p>However, after catching wind of the backlash, Swizz Beatz hopped on Instagram to set the record straight, refuting the change in programming while informing the public that the battle between Hamilton and Soulchild will occur as previously scheduled and will remain on IG Live.</p><p>“See y’all rite here tomorrow on insta @verzuztv,” wrote Swizz, adding, “You can also watch in HD on verzuztv.com. I was out the country don’t ask me who did it. It’s fixed.”</p><p>Swizz’s declaration led to a huge exhale from a large contingent of fans who felt the platform had gone corporate and abandoned the faithful fans who helped build Verzuz from a quarantine past-time into one of the fastest-growing events in the music world, regularly attracting millions of viewers.</p><p>We understand the old adage that money talks and that few things in life are free, still, we hope Swizz, Timbo, Verzuz, and Triller can find a happy medium between growing the business and catering to the fanbase that helped make the partnership possible in the first place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6jEqsbZZpmemaSverOx0qmmp5yjYsOmvtmusWaoka56tbuMsJitm5hifnN%2Fk29rcWtja3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
