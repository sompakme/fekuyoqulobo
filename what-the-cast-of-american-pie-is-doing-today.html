The movie is credited with introducing the world to the term "MILF." Think about how different adult entertainment websites would be without that title. I'm sure it's an achievement that the writer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adam Herz</a>, will want to have on his gravestone.</p><p>The movie was crude, relying on comedy sketches that no other movie would go near at the time. Seriously, movie audiences had never seen anything like&nbsp;American Pie before. What other movie features a scene where the main character has sex with a pie? The characters' bizarre antics were fueled by rumors that many of us would've believed as hormonal teenagers.</p><p>Due to the success of the first film ($235 million at the box office on an $11 million budget), three other sequels were made using the original cast, each grossing over $200 million at the box office. There are three other movies part of the&nbsp;American Pie franchise, but they don't feature the original cast and were not released in theaters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the success of&nbsp;American Reunion (2012), there have 'talks' that there will be a fifth theatrical movie released. Cast member <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tara Reid</a> revealed that the fifth film may be set in Las Vegas. Yes. Please.</p><p>To celebrate (and maybe encourage) the release of the fifth edition in the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;saga, we decided to take a look at the original cast members. After a little digging, we were able to find answers to the question: Where are they now?</p><h2 id=alyson-hannigan-michelle-flaherty>Alyson Hannigan — Michelle Flaherty</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alyson Hannigan</a> is by no means defined by the American Pie franchise. She first found success starring in 144 episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer before landing her role as the "one time at band camp" girl in American Pie.</p><p>After establishing herself as a comedic actress (and appearing in a number of comedy shows like That 70's Show, Rugrats, and King of the Hill), Hannigan played the role of Lily Aldrin on How I Met Your Mother. It's hard to say if her role as Lily is what most people will recognize her by because she had already established herself before appearing in 206 episodes of the hit sitcom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, Hannigan can be seen as the new host of Penn & Teller: Fool Us, taking the position from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Ross</a>. She isn't the best host, but she's trying.</p><h2 id=shannon-elizabeth-nadia>Shannon Elizabeth — Nadia</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shannon Elizabeth</a> won over the hearts of teenage boys while playing Nadia, an Eastern European exchange student. Her role in the American Pie franchise brought her acting career to new heights. Seemingly overnight, she landed roles left, right, and center. She acted in Scary Movie, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Love Actually, and her face (and body) appeared in Maxim magazine in 2000 and 2003. In 2008, she was Maxim's cover girl.</p><p>Shannon Elizabeth's career went down the same path that many pretty faces of Hollywood do: it ended when she got 'too old.' Her appearances in films became less and less, leading her to focus on other parts of her career.</p><p>In 2006, Elizabeth mentioned in an interview that she thought of poker as her second career. She won a cash prize in 12 tournaments from 2006 to 2010 but has only won a single crash prize since then. Her brief poker success can be attributed to her working under the guidance of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Negreanu</a>, arguably the best poker player in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, Elizabeth has been using her social media accounts to raise awareness about rhino poaching and other animal-related issues.</p><h2 id=eddie-kaye-thomas-paul-finch>Eddie Kaye Thomas — Paul Finch</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eddie Kaye Thomas</a> made a name for himself after the first American Pie movie. Following the success of the film, he starred in Freddy Got Fingered (2001) and had a recurring role in the Harold & Kumar franchise as Andy Rosenberg. Besides American Pie, Eddie Kaye Thomas didn't really find a role that he could shine in or even a movie that he could star in, for that matter. It's a shame because he had some serious comedic chops — he just has a very forgettable face.</p><p>Despite having a background in comedic acting, Eddie Kaye Thomas landed a role on the action-drama series, Scorpion. Although the show has average reviews from critics, it has pulled in tens of millions of viewers every week since 2014. That said, the viewership of the show has been declining every year. The 4th season is set to air on September 25, 2017, and the success of this season could be do-or-die for the CBS series</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tara-reid-victoria-vicky-lathum>Tara Reid — Victoria 'Vicky' Lathum</h2><p>Tara Reid was one of the many pretty faces of American Pie. Besides appearing in the four main movies in American Pie, Tara Reid has had somewhat of a shaky career. In addition to starring in a number of terrible B movies, Reid appeared in every Sharknado as the character April Wexler. Whether you love or hate the Sharknado franchise, you have to admit that starring in all five of them is a low point for an actress.</p><p>In the mid-2000s, Tara Reid was criticized by tabloids for her botched plastic surgery. With the aim of giving herself a six pack, Reid underwent liposuction for a new movie role. Unfortunately, the surgery resulted in this weird stomach deformity and an awkward boob job. She had the stomach of a 70-year-old woman. The botched surgery was corrected in 2006, but her body was never the same.</p><p>Most recently, Tara Reid planned to appear in the reality show Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars, but she and her partner (Dean May) were kicked off the show when producers discovered that they weren't actually a couple; they were just friends looking to revamp their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-biggs-jim-levenstein>Jason Biggs — Jim Levenstein</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jason Biggs</a> played Jim Levenstein, the main character of the&nbsp;American Pie franchise. Biggs appeared in the four main American Pie movies. While starring in the franchise, Biggs made few appearances in films, which had intermittent success. Some of these movies include&nbsp;Saving Silverman&nbsp;(2001) and&nbsp;Jersey Girl&nbsp;(2004). Though he found little commercial success, you may recognize Biggs from his 22-episode role as&nbsp;Larry Bloom in the Netflix original,&nbsp;Orange Is The New Black. For an unknown reason, Biggs didn't appear in seasons 3 and 4 of&nbsp;Orange Is The New Black&nbsp;but made a brief cameo in season 5.</p><p>Offscreen, Biggs has voiced Leonardo in a&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon and&nbsp;played cowbell for the group&nbsp;Yukon Kornelius, a band known for inviting celebrities to play an instrument in their songs.</p><p>Despite having a promising career ahead of him in the late 1990s, Biggs has been laying low for the past few years. &nbsp;He was chastised in the media for a number of tweets, which poked fun at Ann Romney, the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, and the death of&nbsp;The Bachelorette&nbsp;contestant Eric Hill.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mena-suvari-heather>Mena Suvari — Heather</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mena Suvari</a> may have been the best actress on the American Pie ensemble. If you like avoiding movies with crude humor and instead prefer dramas, you may recognize Suvari as Angela Hayes in the Academy Award-winning film, American Beauty, which was released the same year as American Pie. It takes serious acting ability to star in two films that have absolutely nothing in common.</p><p>Unfortunately, what goes up must come down. With such a strong start to her acting career, it would have taken a series of perfect roles to make her a household name in the early 2000s. Sadly, it seems that Suvari decided to take parts in as many movies as possible. She appeared in 27 movies in 10 years (1997-2007). This might not be a problem for actors who find commercial success, but most of the movies in Suvari's portfolio flopped at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent years, Suvari has been continuing to find work as an actress. She's been featured in fashion blogs and magazines around the world and is an active spokeswoman for female empowerment issues. She's also toured high schools as a spokesperson for "Circle of Friends," an organization that encourages teenagers to quit smoking.</p><h2 id=natasha-lyonne-jessica>Natasha Lyonne — Jessica</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Natasha Lyonne</a> has had a roller coaster of a career. Until her most recent role (which I'll tell you about later), American Pie was the only noteworthy film that she had been a part of. Her career struggled in the 2000s, and that could be attributed to the legal problems that she faced.</p><p>In the early 2000s, she was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol and for a number of incidents with her neighbors. She was evicted in 2005 after complaints against her were too much for her landlord to deal with. Later that year, Lyonne was admitted to a medical center under a pseudonym, and there, it was revealed that she was suffering from hepatitis C, a heart infection, and a collapsed lung. Her health problems were later treated, and she entered rehab to deal with her addiction problems.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it seemed that Lyonne's career had gone in the direction of so many in Hollywood, she was offered the role of Nicky Nichols in the hit series Orange Is The New Black. The character battles addiction herself, and with so many parallels to her real life, it's no wonder that Lyonne nailed her audition.</p><h2 id=chris-klein-chris-oz-ostreicher>Chris Klein — Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Klein</a> could've been a Hollywood hotshot.&nbsp;American Pie was the second movie he had ever acted in, and he played a main character. For someone breaking into the industry, that's huge! At the start of 2000, following the success of&nbsp;American Pie, Klein began dating actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes</a>. They dated for five years before calling off their wedding and ending their relationship in March 2005 — a month&nbsp;after Klein was arrested for drunk driving. Was it a coincidence? Did the sudden breakup with Katie Holmes end Klein's career?</p><p>As far as his acting career goes, his roles have been pretty much hit and miss. It seemed that every time one of his movies succeeded, he starred in another that failed. He acted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mel Gibson</a>'s&nbsp;We Were Soldiers&nbsp;(2002) and the box office disaster&nbsp;Rollerball&nbsp;(2002).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a number of years, the movies that Klein acted in had smaller and smaller budgets (with the exception of the&nbsp;American Pie movies). His career started off strong, being nominated by the Chicago Film Critics Association as the "Most Promising Actor" because of his role in&nbsp;American Pie,&nbsp;but sadly, it went nowhere due to a problem with alcohol. In 2010, Klein checked into a 30-day alcohol addiction program, and his career has been slowly bouncing back since then.</p><p>In 2015, Klein married longtime girlfriend and travel agent Laina Rose Thyfault. The couple had their first child in 2016. It's always touching to see an alcoholic who's able to turn his&nbsp;life around for the ones he loves!</p><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-stifler-s-mom>Jennifer Coolidge — Stifler's Mom</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Coolidge</a> — the original MILF. There were probably others before her, but as Stifler's Mom, she was the first MILF ever mentioned in American Pie. She's another American Pie actor who has a familiar face despite nobody actually knowing what her name is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, her roles have been far and few between. Typically, she plays a MILF — because that's just how she looks. She appeared as Paulette in Legally Blonde and Legally Blonde 2. She also played the villain in A Cinderella Story and Rosalee in Soul Men.</p><p>In 2011, Coolidge appeared on 2 Broke Girls as Sophie Kaczynski, a recurring role. Due to the popularity of her character, Coolidge was promoted to become a main cast member of the show in the second season. She'll have to find other work, though, as 2 Broke Girls was canceled by CBS earlier this year.</p><h2 id=thomas-ian-nicholas-kevin-myers>Thomas Ian Nicholas — Kevin Myers</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas Ian Nicholas</a> played Kevin Myers, the creator of a pact that many teenage boys tried to follow. That pact, of course, was for him and his friends to lose their virginity before they finished high school. He also inherited the Sex Bible, a mythical book that highlights the dos and don'ts in sex. Every teenage boy wanted this book. Despite his crucial importance to the first film, he barely appeared in the sequels to&nbsp;American Pie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With a disappointing acting career behind him, Nicholas tried to renew his fame starring in the film&nbsp;Walt Before Mickey (2015). The film was more serious than Nicholas's other films but was just seen as OK by movie critics.</p><p>With no hope of starting his acting career over, Thomas Ian Nicholas has turned to performing in a band under his name. He makes the type of music you would expect a former star of&nbsp;American Pie to make.</p><h2 id=seann-william-scott-steve-stifler>Seann William Scott — Steve Stifler</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seann William Scott</a>&nbsp;will always be known as Stifler (though he has acted in other movies). He played the character that every teenage boy wanted to be like. He didn't play Stifler in all of the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;movies, but the other&nbsp;Stiflers were completely lackluster compared to Sean William Scott. He was the kind of character who shared wisdom with the other characters that in weird ways were actually useful. My personal favorite is: when a girl tells you how many guys she's slept with, multiply it by three, and that's the real number.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seann William Scott is the actor whom everybody recognizes but whose name is known by very few people. In addition to starring in the&nbsp;American Pie franchise, he's starred in&nbsp;Final Destination (2000),&nbsp;Road Trip (2000),&nbsp;Dude Where's My Car?&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;The Dukes of Hazzard&nbsp;(2005),&nbsp;Role Models (2008), and&nbsp;Goon&nbsp;(2011).</p><p>Goon&nbsp;is probably one of the most underrated comedies of the past decade. If you haven't taken the time to watch it (even if you're not a hockey fan), watch it as soon as possible.</p><p>Seann William Scott may not be the most diverse actor to ever run through Hollywood, but he's made himself lovable enough for millennials to never forget his face.</p><h2 id=eugene-levy-noah-levenstein>Eugene Levy —&nbsp;Noah Levenstein</h2><p>Of all the actors in&nbsp;American Pie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eugene Levy</a> is the only one who's appeared in all eight films. Until&nbsp;American Pie, Eugene Levy's career was somewhat forgettable. Levy made a name for himself acting in various roles for 8 years on the Canadian sketch comedy program&nbsp;SCTV. After the show ended, he tried to establish himself in the movie business.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, in the years following SCTV,&nbsp;Levy found little fame.&nbsp;His castmates on SCTV (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Candy</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick Moranis</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin Short</a>, to name a few) found much better success in Hollywood than he did.</p><p>Eugene Levy's&nbsp;career was revived by his role as Noah Levenstein, a goofy dad with massive eyebrows. It would be absurd for him to change his eyebrows (despite people ridiculing them) because they're his iconic feature.</p><p>In 2011, Levy was appointed to the Order of Canada for his work in the entertainment industry. It's the second-highest honor in Canada, and it was given to a guy who told his on-screen son to remember his penis cream.</p><p>At 70 years of age, Levy's career has slowed down quite a bit. He voiced a role in&nbsp;Finding Dory&nbsp;but spends most of his time working on Schitt's Creek, a show he stars in, writes, and produces.</p><h2 id=chris-owen-chuck-sherman>Chris Owen&nbsp;—&nbsp;Chuck Sherman</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Owen</a> has one of those faces that make him look a lot younger than he actually is. His entire career has been built on portraying teenagers onscreen, primarily in the&nbsp;National Lampoon's series as well as the&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;franchise. In fact, Chris Owen is one of two cast members to appear in both the theatrical versions of&nbsp;American Pie&nbsp;and the direct-to-video&nbsp;American Pie movies. The other is Eugene Levy, who has a much more prominent role in the&nbsp;American Pie Presents movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently, Chris Owen's acting career has been somewhat dead in the water. In 2014, a&nbsp;New York Daily News article reported that he was working as a waiter in a sushi restaurant in California. A reporter was able to interview Owen, who stated, "Life doesn't always go the way you planned. I love acting and this job lets me stay in the fight."</p><p>Keep trying, Shermanator!</p><h2 id=eric-lively-albert>Eric Lively&nbsp;— Albert</h2><p>Eric Lively is known for three things: being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a>'s older brother, starring in The Butterfly Effect 2, and having a role in&nbsp;American Pie.&nbsp;He's worked on a lot of television shows over the years, but the shows never found mainstream success. He starred in&nbsp;So Weird (1991-2001), A Minute with Stan Hooper&nbsp;(2003-2004), and&nbsp;Modern Men (2006).</p><p>Lively may have found his big break in 2005, when he was offered a recurring role in two different television series:&nbsp;The L Word and&nbsp;24.&nbsp;Ultimately, Lively chose to appear in&nbsp;The L Word because he felt that the subject matter was more important. This, quite possibly, ended his career in the entertainment industry. It's hard to say what success he would've found had he chosen to appear alongside&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiefer Sutherland</a> in&nbsp;24.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lively hasn't made an appearance in anything since 2014, when he made an independent film that was poorly received by critics.</p><h2 id=john-cho-milf-guy-2>John Cho — MILF Guy #2</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Cho</a> changed slang for men around the world with his very brief appearance in&nbsp;American Pie. Though he's somewhat of a household name now, one of his most memorable roles in any movie is MILF Guy #2. And yes, that was the actual name of his character (later changed to John MILF Guy #2 in the sequels).&nbsp;For many people,&nbsp;John Cho was the guy who introduced them to what a MILF is, and his role in&nbsp;American Pie is often credited with making it a household term.</p><p>Cho later found success starring alongside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kal Penn</a>&nbsp;in his own raunchy comedy series,&nbsp;Harold & Kumar. The movies were hit and miss, and it seemed like his short career would come to an end until he was cast in the&nbsp;Star Trek reboot as Hikaru Sulu.</p><p>Stepping outside of his comedy comfort zone, Cho found success acting in science fiction movies. He continues to portray Sulu in the&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;franchise and also appeared in a number of serious roles, such as those in&nbsp;Total Recall&nbsp;and, most recently,&nbsp;Gemini (2017).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources: IMDB; Wikipedia; Daily Mail</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWawoJGperW0xGaamqukYrynecCmnKuhk5a7brzInmSiq12ZvKq6xmarqJyRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
