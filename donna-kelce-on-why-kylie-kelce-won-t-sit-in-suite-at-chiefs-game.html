(Travis’ team <a href=#>beat the Eagles in February</a> to clinch the Lombardi Trophy.)</p><p class=p1>Donna — who shares her sons with ex-husband <strong>Ed Kelce</strong> — noted on Friday that she wasn’t sure where she’d watch <a href=#>the Monday Night Football matchup</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Donna-Kelce-Explains-Why-Son-Jasons-Wife-Doesnt-Plan-to-Sit-in-the-Suites-at-Eagles-Chiefs-Game-inline-2.png><p class=p1>“I’ll probably be sitting in the suites because it will be cold, but I might sit next to her if she wants me there, so that’s a possibility too,” she told podcast host<strong> Jennifer Vickery Smith</strong>, noting it would be difficult to split time in each section. “It’s kind of hard because you can’t watch the game when you’re in the stands. I can’t, I don’t know how she’s going to be able to do it because everyone knows her now too, so maybe if we have security at the end of the rows, they’ll leave us alone, but it’s hard to be in the stadium and not have people come up to you.”</p><p class=p1>Donna continued: “They’re excited, I understand that but we’re there to watch our boys and [Kylie’s] there to watch her husband.”</p><p class=p1>Donna has been both of her sons’ biggest football supporters as they began their careers in the NFL. Earlier this month, she <a href=#>stepped out at Jason’s October 1 home game</a> (alongside <a href=#>Jake From State Farm actor</a>, <strong>Kevin Miles</strong>) before traveling to East Rutherford, New Jersey, in time for Travis’ away game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Donna-Kelce-Explains-Why-Son-Jasons-Wife-Doesnt-Plan-to-Sit-in-the-Suites-at-Eagles-Chiefs-Game.jpg><p class=p1>Donna, who traded her Jason jersey to rep Travis’ number, <a href=#>arrived at MetLife Stadium in time</a> to watch her 33-year-old son — who <a href=#>plays tight end for the Missouri team</a> — take on the New York Jets. When she got there, she met up with <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> in a private suite, who <a href=#>had brought a crew of famous pals</a>, including <a href=#><strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Blake Lively</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Hugh Jackman</strong></a>. (Travis and Swift, 33, have <a href=#>recently started seeing one another</a> after exchanging numbers this summer.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Donna-Kelce-Explains-Why-Son-Jasons-Wife-Doesnt-Plan-to-Sit-in-the-Suites-at-Eagles-Chiefs-Game-inline.jpg><p class=p1>“[Mom has] been on top of the f—king world, man,” Travis gushed<a href=#> during the Wednesday, October 4, episode</a> of his “New Heights” podcast. “I know mom enjoyed it. … I didn’t get a chance to see her, so I shot her a text right after the game on the bus ride to the airport and was like, ‘Hey, Mom, sorry I didn’t get to catch you before I left but I hope <a href=#>you enjoyed the game</a>. I appreciate you always trying to make it to both of our games.’”</p><p class=p1>He added: “It <a href=#>was a hot ticket</a>, man, you know what I’m saying? That suite was rockin.’ They were enjoying themselves. [Mom] told me that everybody was enjoying themselves in that suite.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp56jrm63xKWanmWfo3q4tNhmorKkmZp6rLHLnJxmr5%2BjwW6%2FyK1koqZdqMKqwMRmmK1lk522prLSZp6apZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
