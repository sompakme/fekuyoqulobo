Fans have fallen in love with numerous shows, films, and documentaries that have premiered on <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>. One of their new pieces of original content is a show called Echoes.The Netflix show Echoes stars Michelle Monaghan and Matt Bomer. Fans will recognize Bomer from the hit show White Collar and from the film franchise Magic Mike. Monaghan has also starred in numerous productions, including the Mission: Impossible film franchise and the television series The Path. Echoes tells the story of twins Leni and Gina, both of whom are played by Monaghan, and they’ve decided to switch places. As adults, one of the twins goes missing and both lives begin to unravel. Let’s get into why fans cannot stop talking about Netflix’s Echoes. <span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Fans Really Feel About Never Have I Ever</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-netflix-rsquo-s-echoes-about><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Is Netflix’s Echoes About?</span></h2><p>Echoes is one of Netflix’s newest shows. The first season aired on the streaming service in mid-August of this year, and the show immediately jumped to number 1 on Netflix’s top 10 list. Essentially everyone was binge watching the show and blown away by the numerous twists and turns of the addictive plot.</p><p>The show stars <a href=#>Michelle Monaghan from </a><a href=#>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a>, and she plays identical twins Gina and Leni. The twins have switched lives since they were children, and they share two husbands and a child. Their complicated yet well-choreographed lives begin to fall apart when one of the twins goes missing. This synopsis only begins to scratch the surface of the intense plot of Echoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=fans-call-echoes-rsquo-s-michelle-monaghan-a-ldquo-smoke-show-rdquo><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Fans Call Echoes’s Michelle Monaghan A “Smoke Show”</span></h2><p>While not directly related to the show, fans cannot stop talking about how stunning lead actress Michelle Monaghan is in the role and on her social media. Fans fell in love with Monaghan all over again after watching her incredible performance in Netflix’s Echoes, and now they are flooding her Instagram with positive comments.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans specifically called Monaghan a “smoke show”</a> after she shared some stunning photos of herself on Instagram. She captioned the photo “on point,” and fans certainly agreed.</p><h2 id=what-rsquo-s-the-difference-between-the-twins-in-echoes><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>What’s The Difference Between The Twins In Echoes?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While fans love Netflix’s Echoes, they do have a few complaints. One big issue fans had when watching the show was the lack of distinction between twins Gina and Leni. While viewers understood this was partly intentional—Gina and Leni share each other’s lives, so they are quite similar—but this led to many viewers being confused.</p><p>Fans complained that Gina and Leni were so similar that they did not have any individual characteristics. This also caused viewers to be confused essentially the entire duration of the Netflix show, since they were never totally sure which twin they were watching.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Real People Depicted In Netflix’s Inventing Anna Felt About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=netflix-rsquo-s-echoes-is-full-of-twists><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Netflix’s Echoes Is Full Of Twists</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the reasons fans have loved Netflix’s Echoes is the show’s shock factor. Netflix marketed the new show as a mystery-thriller, and fans certainly all agree that Netflix did their job within the genre. Even by the end of the first episode, viewers were hooked and desperately needed to know what happened next. This is no surprise considering <a href=#>Netflix’s success in the genre with shows like </a><a href=#>You</a>.</p><p>Fans were blown away by the twist ending. The ending had fans scratching their heads: Is Gina dead? Which twin ends up with Charlie? The mysteries continue even after the show is over, and fans are impressed.</p><h2 id=fans-hate-the-green-screen-in-echoes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Fans Hate The Green Screen In Echoes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The largest complaint fans had with Netflix’s Echoes has to do with the production in the final episode of the season. Up until the final episode, there had not been any issues with production and everything looked very realistic. Then, suddenly, a horribly used green screen appeared on screen and fans were very thrown off.</p><p>Fans think the show runners could have found a much better way to film the waterfall scene in the final episode. Many think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the bad green screen ruined the intensity of the moment</a>. It certainly turned a series moment into a laughable event.</p><h2 id=fans-say-echoes-is-a-success><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Fans Say Echoes Is A Success</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All things considered with the twin confusion and the bad green screen, fans still think the show is a huge success. Viewers found the plot to be very engaging, and many chose to binge the entire season in one sitting because they could not wait to find out what happened next.</p><p>Fans have given Echoes a big stamp of approval. Everyone thought Michelle Monaghan gave an incredible performance, which is always tricky when playing multiple characters in the same production. Fans have dubbed Echoes a must-watch from the streaming service.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Meet The Stars Of Selling Sunset’s Spinoff, Selling The OC</a></span></p><h2 id=critics-disagree-with-fans-rsquo-thoughts-on-echoes><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Critics Disagree With Fans’ Thoughts On Echoes</span></h2><p>While viewers have loved watching Netflix’s newest hit show, critics do not have the same thoughts about the show Echoes. Critics found the show to be a let-down and did not love the twists and turns as much as audiences did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One critic, Brian Tallerico, only gave the Netflix show 1.5 stars. He says that “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the potential of Echoes starts to drain before the premiere is even over</a> as it gets goofier and goofier in a way that’s not entertaining but frustrating.” Tallerico also took issue with how the show “over-explains everything” and the “shallow writing and choppy editing.”</p><h2 id=will-netflix-rsquo-s-echoes-get-a-season-2><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will Netflix’s Echoes Get A Season 2?</span></h2><p>Unfortunately, a second season of Netflix’s Echoes has not been announced by the streaming service. To make matters worse, the show is currently listed as a limited series. Typically, <a href=#>this label means that the show will only have one season</a> and fans will not be able to get the answers they hope for with more seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this label of limited series can always change. Considering the show has been such a success with viewers, it would not be surprising if Netflix decided to ditch the label and begin working on a second season. It has happened before, so fans are crossing their fingers that this is not the last time they get to see these characters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdm66vv4ycmKesXajBsLyMrZilo5mjtG6twaisrWWemsGnuMixqmadk528pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
