But sadly, the flood of new pics of Hadid on the runway and backstage has exposed her to body-shaming comments from trolls who are targeting her post-baby body.</p><p>Fans of the star think that the body-shaming comments originated on a part of social media dubbed Eating Disorder Twitter, a section of the site that is dedicated to posting very slim celebrities as "thin inspiration."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One account recently posted a new image of Hadid alongside the caption, "she has big ass arms!!!" But fans of the famous model were quick to jump to her defence, with one replying, "but who's doing runway shows and who's sitting at home thinking about calories?", while another tweeted, "people on [Eating Disorder Twitter] have got to be the biggest losers on this app, bunch of freaks".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gigi Hadid Gets Trolled For 'Ridiculous' Fashion Week Outfit And Baby Bottle</a></span></p><p>And many Twitter users were confused at the comments, declaring that Hadid's arms looked the same in the photo as they always have done. One wrote, "she is literally extremely skinny???" and another tweeted, "Chile did they ever meet any actual plus size people cause dem arms ain't even big..."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hadid recently celebrated the first birthday of her daughter Khai, with an adorable and seemingly extravagant celebration that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was documented by some of her family members</a> on social media. The star was bound to attract some attention from trolls upon her return to the fashion industry after she took an extended period of leave after her daughter's birth last year to focus on looking after her.</p><p>However, fans of <a href=#>Bella Hadid's sister</a> are especially annoyed with the body-shaming comments since they clearly draw attention to the post-partum nature of her current body shape. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One fan wrote</a>, "Body shaming a mother is NEVER okay, their bodies carry a human for 9 months going through many phases. Gigi Hadid is a model but this doesn't mean she has to go back to a size 0 to please you."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Gigi Hadid Fans In Awe Of Her Post Baby Body As She Celebrates 26th Birthday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At least the star herself seems unphased by the new rise in body-shaming comments coming her way. She recently took to Instagram to post <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a series of shots backstage</a> at her latest Versace show, including one sweet clip that shows her hugging Dua Lipa, who is currently dating Hadid's brother, Anwar.</p><p>Hadid also expressed her gratitude, in the post's caption, for the chance to have been "part of fashion history."</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Zayn Malik Fans Are Relieved To See Him In Gigi Hadid's New Post</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYrGmssSnm2afmZy2brTAnaCdZZGbwaa%2BjKyfnmWnlsBuwMCrnp6slZl6o8WMm6adsV2otaK5yKeeZqyipLmtv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
