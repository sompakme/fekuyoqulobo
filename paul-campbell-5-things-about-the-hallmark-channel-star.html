More than 10 years later, <a href=#>he made his Hallmark debut</a>, which he followed up with back-to-back hits in 2015: Surprised by Love and Once Upon a Holiday.</p><p>“That was a good run. Three for three there,” Campbell told <a href=#>My Devotional Thoughts</a> in July 2018. “Once I got a sense of what Hallmark was all about, I was hooked. I wanted to do more and more and more.”</p><p>The Spun Out alum found even <a href=#>more success with the network</a>, starring in eight more films between 2016 and 2021, partly because he bought into the feel-good vibes the company brings to each project.</p><p>“Hallmark Channel is the perfect place for me to be working right now. I love working for them, and they’ve always been really good to me,” the Wedding Every Weekend actor told the outlet. “I really like the content, and now that I have a family, it’s a nice sort of pleasant content where <a href=#>I don’t have to worry about racy, questionable stuff</a>. It’s definitely the direction that I feel I’m headed.”</p><p>The Santa Stakeout star revealed that he would “always jump at the chance” to work on a Hallmark film. “With Hallmark, they realize the value of bringing people back time and again because the audience falls in love with those people,” he added. “<a href=#>Hallmark is a well-run, good company to work for</a>.”</p><p>For his summer 2022 network film, <a href=#>Dating the Delaneys</a>, Campbell reunited with longtime friend and Last Bridesmaid costar <strong>Rachel Boston</strong>.</p><p>The Battlestar Galactica alum <a href=#>teased the project via Instagram in July</a>, calling the film, “A really charming @hallmarkchannel movie with more dad jokes than you can shake a stick at.”</p><p>One month later, Campbell <a href=#>shared a poster for the upcoming movie</a>, which showed him embracing Boston as she held his gaze. “Watch @rachelboston and I hold each other’s necks in the delightful Fall Into Love movie ‘Dating The Delaney’s,’” he joked via social media on August 15.</p><p>The Love, Classified star continued to bring the funny in his <a href=#>2022 “Countdown to Christmas” movie</a>, Three Wise Men and a Baby, which premieres on Saturday, November 19.</p><p>Campbell — who cowrote the film with longtime friend <a href=#><strong>Kimberley Sustad</strong></a> — teased the lighter moments of the holiday feature, which also stars <a href=#><strong>Andrew Walker</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Tyler Hynes</strong></a> as his brothers, during a November Facebook Q&A.</p><p>“The process on this was probably the best creative writing process I’ve had thus far in my entire, albeit, short writing career,” <a href=#>the actor told Hallmark fans at the time</a>.&nbsp;“We feel like we expanded the sandbox in terms of tone … and types of jokes we were telling.”</p><p>Campbell added: “It was so joyous to write this because it’s grounded in a really real place that resonates with people. It was just a beautiful experience from start to finish.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Three Wise Men and a Baby airs on Hallmark Channel Saturday, November 19, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about Campbell:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Blrra4jJyYpqiSmrmteZRmq6GhnpzAbq3BqKytZaSdsm60wKWjppmioHqktMCnpZ6kXajBor6O</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
