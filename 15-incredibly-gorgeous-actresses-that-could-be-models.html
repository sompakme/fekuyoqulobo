Being immersed in the Hollywood life has some sort of magic where it transforms everybody working in the field into some sort of deity. Maybe it's genetics, or maybe it's the money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While models and actresses each have their own sets of skills, it's pretty common to see actresses land modeling gigs and models landing roles in movies or television shows. For example - we've seen <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> in several magazine shoots and we've seen <a href=#>Rosie Huntington-Whitely</a> in Transformers - so it's possible for models to act and actresses to model.&nbsp;When it comes down to it though, it's hard to imagine some actresses not being models. There are some actresses out there who have been graced with such good looks that they should be modelling instead of acting.</p><p>It seems that most Hollywood actresses can do just about anything that they want - so it's not to say that certain actresses couldn't model on the side if they wanted to (we can only hope).&nbsp;Here are 15 actresses so beautiful that they could have made their livings as models.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-angelina-jolie><strong>15. Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> might be 40 years old, that doesn't really stop both men and women for falling for her fleeting looks. She is known for being in movies like&nbsp;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&nbsp;and&nbsp;Maleficient. She is also&nbsp;married to <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and seemingly stole him from underneath <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>'s nose. Jolie, while a great actress, is undeniably timelessly gorgeous. She could find work as a model in a heartbeat if she wanted to, even now at the age of 40.</p><p></p><h2 id=14-megan-fox><strong>14. Megan Fox</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Megan Fox</a> was all the rage back when she was in the Transformers series. She has the dark hair, blue eyes thing going for her that makes most people weak at the knees and incapable of staring. In the past few years though, it seems she's disappeared. Maybe it's the fact that she had a child or got married to <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>, but gorgeous Fox is still only 29 years old - if she wanted to, she could come back as a model in a heartbeat.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-hayden-paniettere><strong>13. Hayden Paniettere</strong></h2><p>Recently, <a href=#>Hayden Paniettere</a> has been gracing the television show Nashville. She became popular in the cheerleading movie series&nbsp;Bring It On,&nbsp;and later resurrected her comfortable role as a cheerleader in Heroes. At just a bit more than a mere five feet, it's unlikely that Paniettere would be able to be a runway model - but her cute, all-American girl looks could definitely land her a Victoria's Secret campaign or two.</p><p></p><h2 id=12-jennifer-aniston><strong>12. Jennifer Aniston</strong></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston has been breaking hearts since her role as Rachel in Friends. She has managed to stay relevant ever since then, not really falling out of the public eye for more than a short while. Every year it seems she's in a new blockbuster, and in the past few years she's finally been able to get married and create a happiness for herself after being heartbroken by Brad Pitt for many years. While Aniston is a little on the older side, it's undeniable that she is gorgeous, fit and could be a model without a doubt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=11-jessica-alba><strong>11. Jessica Alba</strong></h2><p>In the past few years, it seems as if <a href=#>Jessica Alba</a> has disappeared off the big screen, but we're always reminded just how gorgeous she is when she comes around again. She's most notable for her roles in movies like Honey and the Fantastic Four series. She is now spending most of her time as a businesswoman, having established her own line of organic children's products. Seeing how she hasn't been one for acting lately, it's always possible that she could start modelling when she isn't handling her company. Furthermore, look at her, if that's not a model, what is?</p><p></p><h2 id=10-gabrielle-union><strong>10. Gabrielle Union</strong></h2><p>Outside of being married to <a href=#>Dwyane Wade</a>, <a href=#>Gabrielle Union</a> is known from movies like Bring It On, Bad Boys&nbsp;and 10 Things I Hate About You. In her acting career, she has only managed to land supporting roles, and nothing major. She probably could've modeled during her thriving acting career if she wanted to, so maybe the opportunity never presented itself. Even though she's now 43, she could probably still model - she doesn't look a day older than 30 (and that's going hard on her).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=9-julianne-hough><strong>9. Julianne Hough</strong></h2><p>While <a href=#>Julianne Hough</a> is more of a B-list actress than anything else, she's still an actress. She was recently in Grease Live! and has been in a bunch of smaller movies in the past few years. She is probably most recognizable for her participation with the show Dancing With The Stars, where she is one of the coaches and professional dancers. However, she is only a petite five foot, three inches, so she wouldn't be able to be a supermodel anytime soon. She could however, land any sort of print work if she really wanted to.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-amber-heard><strong>8. Amber Heard</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Amber Heard</a> is without a doubt model material. She has the flawless looks, the body, and the height - she's actually 5'8', which is closer to supermodel material than some of the other actresses on this list. But sorry, boys, Heard is married to heartthrob <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a>. Heard can be seen in movies like&nbsp;Zombieland&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Justice League.&nbsp;Heard was recently in the news for potentially going to jail - she's not necessarily a "bad girl" so don't get too excited. She decided to take her dogs with her to Queensland; while it sounds innocent, she smuggled them via private airplane, which is the reason for the scandal. As a celebrity though, she'll probably be fine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-shay-mitchell><strong>7. Shay Mitchell</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Shay Mitchell</a> is actually a model turned actress. She grew up in Canada, and was lucky enough to be chosen as an international model during an open casting call in her hometown. From there, Mitchell was given the opportunity to model in cities like Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Barcelona - but sadly, her true love wasn't modeling. She came back to Toronto after her contract was up so that'd she be able to pursue acting. She's most notably recognized from her role in the hit television series Pretty Little Liars.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-kaley-cuoco><strong>6. Kaley Cuoco</strong></h2><p>For the longest time, <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco</a> was slept on. She plays Penny in The Big Bang Theory (the show we all watch but don't like to admit) which is probably her most notable role. Growing &nbsp;up, she was an actress in many television shows and commercials, so she's no stranger to acting. That being said, she'd make a great model. She has striking green eyes that pop because of her blonde hair - and who doesn't like a blonde? Kaley isn't terribly short, either, so a runway career is something she might be able to pull off.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-mila-kunis><strong>5. Mila Kunis</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> has been the crush of many boys and girls since she hit the screen for That 70s Show - however, know that she was only 14 when she was playing Jackie. She's been a regular on the big screen in the last few years, with titles like Black Swan under her belt. Not only is Kunis just downright beautiful, but she's also unique. The Ukrainian born actress is affected by a disorder called heterochromia - one of her eyes is green, and one is brown, making her even more intriguing to look at. Without a doubt, Kunis could land some print work if she wanted to. Seeing how she's now a mother, modelling and acting might not be at the top of her "to do" list.</p><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-emma-watson><strong>4. Emma Watson</strong></h2><p>Even if you claim to not know who <a href=#>Emma Watson</a> is by name, you definitely know her by her face. She played Hermione in the Harry Potter&nbsp;series, making her one of the most known actresses to date. She has taken plenty of time off from acting as she is very passionate about human rights and has her own campaign, called HeForShe. Watson is often making speeches on women's rights, speaking with the UN, and generally trying to make the world a better place. It's not uncommon to see her gracing the covers of magazines like Elle and Vogue, but it wouldn't hurt to see some more of her, either.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-jennifer-lawrence><strong>3. Jennifer Lawrence</strong></h2><p>It's hard to feel connected to actors and actresses just because they're involved in a life that's so far from reality, but Jennifer Lawrence is probably one of the only celebrities that is easy to relate to. She seems like a genuinely down-to-Earth girl with a quirky sense of humor who hasn't let fame go to her head. She is of course primarily known for her role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games series, which has been one of the most popular series in the past decade. Lawrence isn't a stick like most women in Hollywood - she has actual curves and isn't afraid to show them. Lawrence would be a great model for anybody who's willing to use a model that isn't the "typical" kind of body type.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-blake-lively><strong>2. Blake Lively</strong></h2><p>Seeing <a href=#>Blake Lively</a> just once is enough to make anybody fall in love. Not only does she have the tall thing going for her, but she also has pale blue eyes and very light blonde hair - basically the epitome of all-American beauty. She's been in plenty of movies, as well as the hit television series Gossip Girl. Nowadays, Lively is married to <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a> and is a mother, so being a model probably isn't high on the list of opportunities for her - however, that doesn't discredit the fact that she could have been taken up that career at any time.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-nina-dobrev><strong>1. Nina Dobrev</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a> is a little less famous than she should be - she's an amazing actress and is stunning. Not only does she have a unique sort of timeless beauty, but she also looks like she's about twenty when she's really twenty seven. Although Dobrev grew up in Canada, she's Bulgarian. She can be seen in the television series The Vampire Diaries, as well as Degrassi - outside of that, most of her work has been on small time television or straight to television movies. Regardless of her dull acting career, it's hard to deny that this stunner would do well as a model; if she did, it'd be a fair competition for <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sources:</strong><a href=#>IMDB</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqbV2eu6S%2BxJ2gm6SpYrSwvsaepq6rXZawtb7ErKqeq12ptaLAjJymrqSUYq%2Bmecyom56ko2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
