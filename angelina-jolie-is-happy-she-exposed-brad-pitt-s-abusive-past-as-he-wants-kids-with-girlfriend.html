But as it appears she’s pulling out the last of her reserves as she aims to maintain primary custody of their minor kids, a new report says Angelina has no regrets.</p><p>“Angie is glad the truth is finally out there,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider told Life & Style</a> . “Brad, on the other hand, is at his wit’s end, telling friends that this nightmare never ends.

And if Angelina is going to submit recordings proving her allegations, he may have even more incentive to agree.</p><p>Brad and Angelina’s kids have reportedly egged their parents to put an end to the court battle, with Shiloh even requesting to live with her famous father, despite Brad allegedly being on tense terms with his older children. Evidence of this includes a leaked Instagram post written on a past Father’s Day by his son, Pax, which called Brad out for allegedly being an absence dad. His oldest daughter, Zahara, also appeared to have dropped his surname and is just going by Angelina’s last name, Pitt, while attending college.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brad-reportedly-wants-kids-with-his-girlfriend-despite-his-ongoing-custody-battle>Brad Reportedly Wants Kids With His Girlfriend Despite His Ongoing Custody Battle</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/brad-pitt-and-ines-de-ramon-1.jpg><p>The actor appears to be thinking about the future, especially when it comes to his relationship with Ines De Ramon, who’s nearly 30 years older than her. <a href=#>Reports say Pitt wants to have children</a> with Ines as well as settle down.</p><p>“Brad and Ines are smitten with each other and she recently moved into his Los Feliz mansion, proving how serious they are,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an insider claimed to Closer Magazine</a>. “He’s known from the outset that Ines wants to become a mum and that’s something they discussed very early on, given their 30-year age gap.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/these-brad-pitt-movies-have-grossed-over.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>These Brad Pitt Movies Have Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Brad Pitt is one of the most well-known leading men in Hollywood and has been for nearly three decades now.
