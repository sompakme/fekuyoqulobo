Through our partnership with Vaseline®, we’re committed to increasing awareness of the importance of health through skincare. We’re honored to have the opportunity to partner with and lend our platform to amplify Vaseline’s Equitable Skincare for All campaign.”</p><p>Hopefully through this event, King, BET and Vaseline will bring more visibility to this issue so that product lines expand faster, in order to help everyone gain access to the skincare they need.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Regina King Amassed Her $12 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnp%2BZo65ut8innmaalal6orrDZq2aq5Whtq%2BxjJqpnmWnpL%2Bstc2gZK2nl5rBqbHRZp%2BepKBisrex0bKmp51dqb%2BmrdNmmaWZk6B6tLfIp2SbnaSpsrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
