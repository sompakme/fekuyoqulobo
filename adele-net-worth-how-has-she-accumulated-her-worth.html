That October, she was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live when <strong>Sarah Palin </strong>appeared on the show, and it was the highest-rated episode ever at the time, clocking in a whopping 17 million viewers.</p><p>“<strong>It was supposed to be like, a normal show, just me and Josh Brolin—I was the musical guest and he was hosting it. And then we walk in on Saturday and Sarah Palin was there,</strong>” Adele once recalled. “<strong>We were like, ‘Oh God!’ And it ended up being a huge show, and literally overnight—like, whenever I’ve heard that saying, ‘overnight success,’ I was like, ‘Yeah whatever, they probably worked for it.’ And it was overnight, completely overnight!
