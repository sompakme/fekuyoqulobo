After striking it big as a co-star on the show Pawn Stars, Austin “Chumlee” Russel announced his plans to open a candy shop.

Could there already be another Chumlee candy store out there in the world?</p><p>Of course not. The domain names were snatched up by Patrick Keys, who after hearing about Chumlee’s store, snatched up the names with the intent to sell them to the candy store proprietor later.</p><p>The practice is called "cybersquatting", where someone registers a domain name on the cheap and then sells it to someone else later on for a huge profit. Registering a domain name can cost as little as a few bucks a year, but the payoff down the line could be in the thousands or even millions of dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>CHUMLEE SELLING LAS VEGAS INFAMOUS PARTY HOME</a></strong></p><p>Cybersquatting is technically illegal in the United States, but it’s often much cheaper to pay off the cybersquatter than to mount a legal challenge. And sometimes suing the squatter is impossible if they live in another country. <a href=#>Kevin Spacey</a>, for example, couldn’t get his name on a website for years as the owner of the domain&nbsp;lived in Canada.</p><p>Keys is an American, so is totally fair game. He’s also been playing the cybersquatting game for 20 years and makes enough annually to call it a career.</p><p>Chumlee is having none of this cybersquatting nonsense though. His lawyers sent Keys a cease and desist letter today to get Keys to give up the domain, otherwise, he’ll be forced to sue. If Keys can’t come up with a good excuse as to what he was going to do with those domain names, the courts can award them to Chumlee, who will then bring Las Vegas candy to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3yxrdanZKyskafAbq%2FHrqSlnZVisKK6w7JkrKyfp7JuuMSgmKVlkpbBtbjEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
