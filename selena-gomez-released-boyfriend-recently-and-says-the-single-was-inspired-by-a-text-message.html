Gomez has been through some tough relationships, especially with her famous ex-boyfriends Justin Bieber and The Weekend. Luckily, Gomez grew from the pain and came out on the other side, victorious.</p><p>On her new bonus track <a href=#>Boyfriend</a>&nbsp;off her Rare album, Gomez tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a>&nbsp;all about the trials and tribulations of falling in love. The singer takes things a little farther when she starts turning guys into frogs in her new music video. If only a power like that existed in real-life.</p><p>While the music video has over 10 million views, the title alone was enough to catch the attention of adoring fans. Though no one seemed more excited for the song’s release than the singer herself. “Many of you know how excited I’ve been to release a song called Boyfriend, the singer wrote on her Instagram page on April 6.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>What's Old Is New Again As Selena Gomez Buys Tom Petty's Mansion For Nearly $5 Million</a></p><h2 id=gomez-s-inspiration-for-the-song-came-from-a-text>Gomez’s Inspiration For The Song Came From A Text</h2><p>After having witnessed the spellbinding music video, all fans want to know now is how the song came about. While people we’re expecting Gomez to admit the song originated from her past relationships, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Geo</a> revealed that Boyfriend drew inspiration from a silly text to her songwriters.</p><p>Songwriters Julia Micheals and Justin Tranter gave Apple Music the rundown of how the song came to be. Micheals candidly recalls the message Gomez sent to them, stating, “Well, it's like I feel like I've covered everything on the album. I was like, I don't know. Life's good. I want a boyfriend. That's about it.' And she's like, 'LOL, whatever. And I come in the studio and that's literally the title.”</p><p>NEXT: <a href=#>Selena Gomez Reveals She Is Bipolar On Instagram Live</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqSVo65us86mnLNlopq5pq3Snptmmp%2Bus7O1xKebZqqVmLKvwMuyZJqmlGLAosXSZquhnV2otq%2Bzy55ksJmjYravv8%2BiqZ6cXZfGbq2MrZyxrF2isrS%2FwKCcaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
