Jennifer Coolidge admitted that Reese Witherspoon “can do no wrong” while addressing Legally Blonde 3 rumors.
“I mean Big Little Lies — if you just look at her body of work, The Morning Show and everything, she’s just a superstar,” Coolidge, 58, told Us Weekly exclusively at the Like a Boss world premiere in New York City on Tuesday, January 7. “She’s an absolute superstar and she always has been.”
The two actresses have kept in touch after starring in 2001’s Legally Blonde, in which the Massachusetts native played nail salon worker Paulette and Witherspoon, 43, played Elle Woods, and reprising their roles in the 2003 sequel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
