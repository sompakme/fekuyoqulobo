It is also about vegetarian and non-vegetarian food preferences and the options made available according to that. However, some <a href=#>restaurants go overboard to make special pizzas</a> that are meant particularly for the elite. The cost, manufacturing, and availability of ingredients used in making these pizzas also make a huge difference in the contrast of the price.</p><p>These are some of the most expensive pizzas in the world.</p><h2 id=the-magic-gold-pizza>The Magic Gold Pizza</h2><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Most Expensive Sunglasses 2021</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Magic Gold Pizza is a major hit among pizza lovers since it is a relatively healthier option. Its dough is gluten-free, which makes it one of the best options for vegans looking to enjoy something tasty and appetizing at the same time.</p><p>This special pizza is prepared by the Magic Oven restaurant chain, which is quite popular in Toronto, Canada. The most attractive feature of this exclusive pizza is the 24-carat gold garnishing. That is also what makes this pizza cost about $108 and makes it count as one of <a href=#>the most expensive ones in the world</a>.</p><h2 id=gordon-ramsay-s-pizza>Gordon Ramsay’s Pizza</h2><p>The most famous and expensive pizza to be found in the Maze restaurant of London is the Gordon Ramsay Pizza. It has been famously named after the best-known chef in London and the rest of the world. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Ramsay special comes with a horde of luxury toppings</a>, including Italian onion puree, white truffle pasta, buffalo mozzarella, fontina, fresh herbs, pancetta, and cep mushrooms.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than <a href=#>the legacy of Gordon Ramsay</a>, it is the use of such fancy ingredients that makes this pizza one of the costliest in the world with a price of about $250. This pizza once held the record of being the most expensive in the world by the Guinness book before more expensive ones took it.</p><h2 id=the-c6-pizza>The C6 Pizza</h2><p>The C6 is the holiest creation of British Columbia’s Steveston Pizza, and it is world-famous. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I</a>ts toppings are as follows- smoked salmon, tiger prawns, lobster thermidor, and black Alaskan cod, with a side of Russian Osetra caviar.</p><p>This <a href=#>unique combination of ingredients</a> makes up for the special flavored delicacy. It is also the best-seller of Stevenson Pizza. The use of such materials also accounts for the mind-blowing price of the C6; it comes at about $450.</p><h2 id=not-so-poor-man-s-pizza>‘Not-So-Poor Man’s Pizza</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If there were ever a pizza prize that indicated its high price through its name, the winner would be Margo’s Mistra Bay’s Not-So-Poor Man’s Pizza. Like every other fancy pizza, this one too comes with the most exquisite toppings, including a 24-karat gold leaf, Italian white truffles, and fresh organic water buffalo mozzarella.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">T</a>hese truffles are shipped from Alba within hours of harvest and the making of the pizza. The pizza gets delivered after a week of its ordering, and it comes at the hefty price of about $2400.</p><h2 id=pizza-royale-007>Pizza Royale 007</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All James Bond fandoms must surely be in love with the Pizza Royale 007 as it is themed after the action hero, as the name suggests. The magic ingredients that make this pizza <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the best tributes to the James Bond franchise</a> is the use of 24-karat gold dust, champagne-soaked caviar, and a lobster that is marinated in 100-year-old cognac as toppings.</p><p><a href=#>James Bond is the symbol of everything classy</a>, smooth and stunning; the Pizza Royale 007 created by Domenico Crolla in Glasgow stands up to those expectations. It is like an extension of the James Bond legend and comes at a jaw-dropping cost of about $4,200.</p><h2 id=pizza-for-lovers>Pizza For Lovers</h2><p>Pizza lovers always associate the emotion of love with pizza, but what makes Pizza For Lovers exclusive is a secret ingredient. Speaking of regular pizza ingredients, this one also uses items like <a href=#>different sorts of cheese</a> and tomato sauce along with one’s own choice of toppings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What makes this pizza stand out, however, is the shape it comes in. One could hardly imagine a pizza in a heart shape before Favitta’s Family Pizzeria in Henrietta, New York, devised it. The secret ingredient that adds to its hefty price of $8,180 is diamond. It either comes in the form of diamond dust or a diamond ring with one bottle of Dom Perignon champagne.</p><h2 id=louis-xiii-pizza>Louis XIII Pizza</h2><p>Louis XIII Pizza is certainly the most expensive pizza globally, and the amount of time required to make this masterpiece partly explains why it is so costly. It takes about three days to make a perfect Louis XIII Pizza. Another factor that results in the high cost is the list of ingredients used to make this wonder happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The dough itself is made using Arabian fur, which is mixed with pink salt dust and thus the crust that has to be made 72 hours before adding toppings. Different types of caviar, organic buffalo mozzarella, different types of cheese, prawns from Cilento, mantis shrimp, and lobster are used as toppings. No wonder an entire Louis XIII Pizza comes at a whopping price of about $12000, although one has the option of purchasing half of it at $6000.</p><p>As the extravagant cost makes it evident, pizzas can also be made expensive with the addition of exclusive items on them. Foodies, however, should try them out for a ‘one-time experience’ because more than the status quo, these pizzas are also about <a href=#>their exquisite taste and flavor</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Nutella Billionaire: How Giovanni Ferrero Became The Richest Italian</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haute Living</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">World Atlas</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hungry Howie</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manoosh Pizzeria</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxatic</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yoqq1lla29prrSoq2eZaCex7ut0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
