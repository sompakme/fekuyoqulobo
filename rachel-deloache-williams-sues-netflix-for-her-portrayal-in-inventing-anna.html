She’s accusing Netflix of exaggerating her portrayal in the show for “dramatic purposes.”</p><p>Specifically, Rachel is accusing Netflix of intentionally portraying her as “<a href=#>as a greedy, snobbish, disloyal, dishonest, cowardly</a>, manipulative and opportunistic person.” She’s also taking issue with how the show makes it appear that she was quick to accept lavish gifts from the faux socialite.</p><p>“In reality, [Rachel] never did or said those things,” he court filing states. “Thus, this action is based firmly on statements of fact which are demonstrably false and the attribution of statements that she never made.”</p><p>Rachel, a former Vanity Fair editor, is also challenging the show’s allegation that she only stopped being friends with Anna when she had financial troubles following their trip to Morocco.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“<a href=#>Williams did not stop being friends</a> with Sorokin because Sorokin was having problems in Morocco,” the lawsuit continues. “But rather because she subsequently discovered on her return to New York that Sorokin was a liar and a con artist whose statements and promises had induced Williams to incur liabilities of around $62,000 on Sorokin’s behalf were false, and who only reimbursed her $5,000 despite numerous promises to reimburse her $70,000 to account for the full debt and any late fees incurred.”</p><p>It's unclear how much Rachel is hoping to make in damages from the defamation case.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Alec Baldwin Facing $25 Million Defamation Lawsuit Filed By Late Marine's Family</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Washington Post</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Foq%2FHnqNmnJWhvKKvx55ksKGcobaiudJmqq6do2K7psDFpaCxZZakv260xKtkqaeiqb%2BixcClZKKmXZ67t7HNraCnn12Wu6%2Btjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
