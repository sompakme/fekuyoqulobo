When <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> appeared on the screen during that movie, she was a vision. A lot of people envied Shia LaBeouf, who played her love interest, but the dreams of lovestruck fans were shattered when she went on to marry Brian Austin Green. Fox and Green would go on to have three children together before they divorced, with Fox helping Green to raise another child of his from a former relationship with Vanessa Marcil.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Besides having beauty and a family, Fox also had a thriving career in Hollywood. She starred in movies such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Jennifer's Body and This is 40.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox Blames Hollywood For Unhealthy Expectation And Ruining Her Body Image</a></span></p><p>Throughout her decades-long career, Fox managed to amass a net worth of $10 million through 2020. However, 2023 brought a different story, given that her net worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decreased to $8 million</a>. While still an impressive amount, given her divorce from Green, more expenses fall Fox's way. So, how does Fox spend the money she does have?</p><p><strong>Updated July 2023:</strong> In 2023, Megan Fox saw her net worth decrease from $10 million to $8 million. This could have to do with fewer movie roles that she has been taking as of late. It could also have to do with the divorce settlement between herself and her ex, Brian Austin Green.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Fox does have three projects that are already in post-production. As such, her net worth should rise. And, if she does eventually marry Machine Gun Kelly, their combined net worth will make her $8 million jump to the $30+ million mark. All the more money to spend as she pleases.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-homes><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Megan Fox's Homes</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/megan-fox-1.jpg><p>It was after Fox starred in Transformers that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she decided to buy a home</a> in Sherman Oaks, California. Then, when she got married to Green, the couple bought a home together for $3.4 million in Toluca Lake, California.</p><p>However, when the two separated, they listed their 3-bedroom home for significantly less than they paid. And when it finally sold, it was at a loss for $2.6 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox Was Banned From Walmart When She Was Young And It May Have Something To Do With Her Extremely Rough Childhood</a></span></p><p>Since that time, Fox purchased a home in the hills of Malibu. But after having issues with mold, she decided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sell the house in 2023 for a cool $4.5 million.</a> That does not mean that Fox is homeless, however. She has been living with her fiance, Machine Gun Kelly in his $7.3 million Encino, California home.</p><p>While there are no reports to date whether Fox is still living in the home as the <a href=#>two continue to work on their relationship</a> after it was rumored that Kelly cheated, there is nothing pointing to the fact that Fox is living elsewhere. As such, it does not appear that any of Fox's money is going toward a rent or mortgage currently.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-donations><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Megan Fox's Donations</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3-3.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not a secret that Fox tries to help out when she can. She appeared in Eminem's video for Love The Way You Lie. Instead of going out and spending what she earned from that gig on herself, Fox donated the money to a shelter for abused women. That was noble and she deserves a lot of credit for it.</p><p>Fox also teamed up with an organization called Redline Steel in 2020. The organization helps veterans and their families get on their feet during rocky times. And since Fox's involvement, as of 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has helped Redline Steel bring in millions.</a></p><p>In addition to the various other charitable organizations that Fox is associated with, she also regularly donates to the Humane Society and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-family-trips><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Megan Fox's Family Trips</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/megan-fox.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Fox and Green were married, they found it hard to get their kids out for major family trips. This was because their kids were small at the time but also because it was hard to get away as a family with the professional lives the two led. However, they managed to get away for a family trip to Disneyland in 2019. A trip that was not cheap to do for a family of five.</p><p>Since her divorce from Green, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox got away to Greece with Kelly and all their kids in 2021</a>. There are no reports as to an estimate for travel expenses and for excursions. However, international travel can be costly.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-video-games><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Megan Fox's Video Games</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>More and more women have jumped on the video game bandwagon. Mila Kunis isn't the only female celebrity that enjoys playing video games. Fox is another. She said that she enjoys playing Mortal Kombat, which is a fighting game. And she is so good at it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox dominated Kelly every time they play it.</a></p><p>"We got the latest Mortal Kombat, we downloaded it, and I crushed him," Kelly stated. "Like, destroyed him every time we fought."</p><p>Fox went on to say, "Boys just naturally assume that they’re gonna be better than you at gaming. [even after] like, 40-something matches, [during which] I absolutely destroyed him every time."</p><p>Besides playing video games, Fox is also featured in a video game.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Megan Fox's Kids</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/how-often-does-megan-fox-see-her-children_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taking the kids to Disney World isn't the only way that Fox splashes out cash on her kids. She has three kids with Green and for a time, was stepmother to Green's child. So, that was four kids who needed to be clothed, have activities/toys at their disposal, and have college funds set up. Luckily, Fox can provide, thanks to her high-paying acting jobs, even when <a href=#>she does not get to see them all the time</a>.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-vacations><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Megan Fox's Vacations</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/th-image-template-12.jpg><p>One of the perks of being a Hollywood actress is that you've got some time during the year to get on a plane and fly away to a tropical destination. Of course, famous actresses also have the money for getaways. When Green and Fox were together, they decided to go away on vacation to Hawaii. They've vacationed in Hawaii more than once.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox and Kelly have also spent time vacationing in Hawaii.</a> In addition, they have traveled without the kids to Greece, Italy, and other European destinations.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-shopping><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Megan Fox's Shopping</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar50648702-1.jpg><p>Being a celebrity means that Fox always tries to look her best. She enjoys wearing designer clothing. And as of late, the amazing designer duds she has been wearing have led to those in the fashion world to call this the "Fashion Girl" era for Fox.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox also shops at Erewhon</a>, the most expensive grocery store in the US. It is not uncommon for a small bag of groceries to cost well over $100.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Megan Fox's Parents Probably Would't Approve Of How She Lives Her Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Fox has a love of vintage, as seen by her designer engagement ring, it would not be unheard of for there to be other touches of vintage in her life. Be it from art to interior design. Shopping for these items can be pricey but it takes some serious time and dedication as well.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-cars><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Megan Fox's Cars</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar51410076.png><p>While Fox enjoys driving around town in a Range Rover, she is also content with a luxury sedan. Her preference is a BMW 535d. However, she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of other vehicles to drive around in as well</a>. Those cars include everything from the Aston Martin DB11, the MERCEDES-BENZ G63 AMG, the Mercedes G550 AMG, the Tesla Model X, the MERCEDES CLS 55 AMG, and the BMW X5.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-tattoos><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Megan Fox's Tattoos</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar50651583.jpg><p>Not only does Fox spend money on getting tattoos, but she also spends money on removing them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox has 20 tattoos</a>. From Chinese symbols to Shakespeare, poems, and celestial bodies, and so much more, all the tattoos that are on Fox's body have meaning.</p><p>However, a Marilyn Monroe tattoo she once had, she decided to remove.</p><p>"I'm removing it. It is a negative character, as she suffered from personality disorders and was bipolar," Fox explained. "I do not want to attract this kind of negative energy in my life." This is because <a href=#>Fox, too suffers from mental illness</a>. And because of this, she did not want reminders of it on her body.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With tattoos <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">costing between $50 to several thousand dollars</a>, there has been a lot of money invested in Fox's tattoos. And given that she has a love for the art, she may get more before it is all said and done.</p><h2 id=megan-fox-39-s-costco-shopping><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Megan Fox's Costco Shopping</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar50518290-1.jpg><p>There are numerous celebrities who shop at Costco. One of them is Fox.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox was quoted as saying</a>, "If I ever lose a role because of my tattoos, I'll quit Hollywood and go to work at Costco." That sums up how much she loves the popular wholesale chain. And given the number of times that Fox has been photographed coming out of the big box store, it is clear that a pretty penny is being spent there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3qnu9dmpZ6sXay8s8DHZqSipJyevK%2B%2FjKWgn52jqcatsY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
