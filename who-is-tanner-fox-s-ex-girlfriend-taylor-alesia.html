Caniff got famous for his videos uploaded on his Vine channel. He reached over 2.3 million followers, and he also has a YouTube channel with over 400.000 subscribers. Thanks to this, Taylor Alesia got a lot of exposure, and it was rumored that they were dating during that time while she was helping him doing the RV Project Tour.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Celebrity Has The Most Fake Instagram Followers?</a></span></p><p>Nevertheless, later on, Taylor Caniff revealed that they were not dating in an interview with a San Diego TV station, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superfame</a>. He also said that he was single and not dating anyone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alesia was not pleased with his interview as he promised to keep in touch and take her to Texas.

In 2018, she earned between 1.500 to 23.700 dollars which was pretty good for someone who started reuploading on her YouTube channel.

Her name is Alli Compton, and she is active on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</p><p>As a curious fact and according to the media, Taylor is about 1.52 m (5 ft 0 in tall) while Tanner Fox's height is 1.68m (5 ft 6 in tall). Now let's take a look at her ex-boyfriend's rise to fame.</p><h2 id=tanner-fox-s-rise-to-fame>Tanner Fox's Rise to Fame</h2><p>Tanner Fox's achievements are pretty impressive. He has 10.5 million subscribers on YouTube and 4.3 million followers on Instagram. He ranked 40th in the 2016 World Scooter Finals, and he also has his own clothing line: TFox.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fox was a kid from sunny California who had a passion for scooter stunts and movie making. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He started his YouTube channel just before he turned 11 years old to upload scooter stunts</a>. Tanner posted stunt and trick videos of him and his friends for the first four years, but by mid-2015, things began to pick up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why These 10 YouTubers Attract So Much Controversy</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only did Tanner become a world competitor in scooter events, but his YouTube channel had also begun to gain some serious traction. With the new addition of webisodes and a very determined seven-year-old on a Hoverboard, Tanner went viral, and in the last year, his channel has blown up.</p><h2 id=sports-prodigy>Sports Prodigy</h2><p>Tanner Fox was born in San Diego, California. Growing up in SoCal, there was lots for a kid to do outdoors, and at the age of 11, Tanner was interested in heading to his local skate park to try tricks with his bike. While there, he found it quite difficult, but a group of kids on scooters caught his attention. They seem to be having a way better time, so Tanner decided to ditch his bike and ask for a scooter instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the age of 12, Tanner's scooter skills had grown. He began competing, and with the help of pro scooter Dakota Schuetz, he got a sponsorship with Lucky Scooters. Fox's deal with Lucky allowed him to compete worldwide, and by the age of 15, he's been to Australia, Spain, and the UK.</p><p>2015 was a big year for Tanner's scooter career and his channel as well. That year he began to switch things up, posting videos from his life outside of the skatepark. With his Instagram, he made call-the-shots videos where fans could comment on the tricks they wanted him to do and everyone's favorite: Hoverboard videos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-once-deeply-in-love>They Were Once Deeply in Love</h2><p>In 2016, Tanner stepped up his YouTube game. He began posting on a daily basis. Fox attended VidCon, and his content was evolving even further, including the beginning of his very popular exploration videos.</p><p>Alesia and Tanner began dating in 2017 but broke up somewhere along the way. In an interview in February 2021, Tanner went into a little bit of detail about their breakup.</p><p>But, for the most part, they've both been really silent about it. And according to Alesia's Instagram, it appears as though she has moved on with her life and found herself a new boyfriend. Albeit, not one nearly as famous. But maybe that's a good thing.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott Fuel Dating Speculations After Disneyland Date With Stormi</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmqaemr9uss6xZKChoqGzs7XEp5tmr5ikeqq%2FjK2YsqSfp3qiuMSsoJpn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
