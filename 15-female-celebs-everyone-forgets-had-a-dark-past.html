While the media and focus is now on bringing awareness and change to the prevalence of s*xual assault that women face in institutions as ingrained in our society as the work force, another issue brought about in the midst of prosecuting and seeking justice for victims by these major motion picture and television business moguls is the lack of true knowledge as to what lies in the pasts of many of these highly-regarded, accolade-achieving individuals and what secrets they may be currently hiding in their personal lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, while it is evident that the vast majority of “dirt” and dark personal histories may be mostly affiliated with the male gender in the sphere of the Hollywood work environment, some of the women in movies and television today, who have gone on to receive Oscars, Emmys, and Golden Globes, have additionally had some truly horrifying and dark pasts in their now-celebrated lives.</p><p>The following are 15 iconic Hollywood starlets with some of the most dark and disturbing histories within the realm of celebrities:</p><h2 id=michelle-pfeiffer><strong>Michelle Pfeiffer</strong></h2><p>After arriving in Los Angeles as a promising and aspiring actress, the now highly-acclaimed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a> once became involved with a couple who were teachers of “Breatharianism.” Breatharians believe that like plants, humans too can achieve photosynthesis and can therefore absorb any and all nutrients accordingly from the sun’s light, without any food or water. The eccentric ‘religion’ is currently guided by Jasmuheen, a self-proclaimed “Ambassador of Peace, International lecturer, author, and leading researcher,” and has moreover been the cause of numerous fatalities in multiple deaths over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a historic interview with Michelle Pfeiffer by The Telegraph, Pfeiffer said, “I had to pay for all the time I was there, so it was financially very draining. They believed that people in their highest state were breatharian.” Pfeiffer and the other minds that the couple managed to manipulate were expected to live in accordance with this strict lifestyle. Michelle Pfeiffer didn’t realize that she was involved with a cult until she was helping her first husband, Peter Horton, prepare for a role in a movie about Reverend Sun Myung Moon’s cult. Only then did the actress realize that the couple she was involved with was most certainly a truly disturbed cultist practice and decided to leave.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=winona-ryder><strong>Winona Ryder</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Winona Ryder</a> is one of the most beloved actresses of our time, establishing herself early as a young Goth romantic in the popular comedy-horror movie Beetlejuice, and moving on to Oscar-winning, critically acclaiming roles in Heathers, The Crucible,&nbsp;and Black Swan, as well as the new popular Netflix original production Stranger Things.&nbsp;One would have trouble believing that the starlet had any trouble growing into her high-profile status as a celebrity. When Ryder was merely seven years old, her family moved to the “Rainbow Family Commune of Living,” a large farm complex in Mendocino, California where the family lived with seven other families. At the complex, which lacked any electricity, television, or music, the intense societal repression pushed Ryder into the world of literature, and she first began developing an interest in acting. After her time at the complex during which Ryder rose to stardom, the young actress still managed to get involved in some petty offenses, even getting caught shoplifting while nonchalantly attempting to carry thousands of dollars worth of merchandise right out the front door at the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=glenn-close><strong>Glenn Close</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glenn Close</a>,&nbsp;the 6-time Oscar Award-nominated actress, has made a notable mark in numerous motion picture productions throughout her career. Despite her current popularity as one of the most talented actresses in Hollywood, what Glenn Close’s past contains is rather dark. When she was seven years old, her parents joined the Moral Re-Armament (MRA) cult, an extreme conservative group, and remained involved with the group for 15 years. Practices and beliefs of the MRA cult were based around four absolutes—absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. Despite the harsh ideals of the group, Glenn Close ending up touring the world with the MRA singing chorus, Up The People, until she was in college. She now holds that the cult experience actually helped boost her abilities as an actress, having had to fake her role and belief in the cult throughout while she was with her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rose-mcgowan><strong>Rose McGowan</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose McGowan</a> has made recent headlines for her involvement with the recent shocking discoveries about Harvey Weinstein, but this was not the only time McGowan was involved in more sinister aspects of an institution. Growing up in Florence, Italy with her father, who ran an Italian chapter of the Children of God cult, Rose McGowan got her fill of patriarchal misogyny early on in life. As a child, McGowan traveled to several other communes in Europe as part of her involvement with the cult, which believed in the maintaining of free love, in coordination with prepping for the second coming of Jesus Christ. The cult encouraged members, including the children, to&nbsp;'do the deed'&nbsp;at a young age. Fortunately enough, McGowan and her family escaped before she had to engage in any of the abhorrent practices of the Children of God.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patricia-arquette><strong>Patricia Arquette</strong></h2><p>Internationally-recognized Oscar and Golden Globe Award-winning actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patricia Arquette</a>, known for her role as Allison Dubois in episodes of the Golden Globe Award-nominated series Medium,&nbsp;as well as for her role in the renowned drama Boyhood, has also seen her fair share of cultist practices prior to her rise to fame in Hollywood.

The belief held by those who practiced this rare religion believe in awakening the inner self in order to gain more fulfillment in life. Arquette lived in the commune with the rest of her family and her parents’&nbsp;friends where they endured the wrath of her abusive drug-addicted father, Lewis Arquette, who treated the family’s five children horribly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlize-theron><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></h2><p>In recent years, the gorgeous, talented, fierce-eyed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charlize Theron</a> has made her move towards roles as a producer on upcoming feature productions, having already established herself on top as one of the most acclaimed actresses of her time for her unparalleled deliverance in roles like Aileen Wuornos in Monster&nbsp;(for which she received an Oscar), as well as her roles in Mad Max: Fury Road and Prometheus.

Madonna revealed in an interview with Harper’s Bazaar that the perpetrator dragged a then-young Madonna–approximated to be in her early 20’s at the time–with a knife to her back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pamela-anderson><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pamela Anderson</a> is one of the most iconic blonde bombshells of television, having distinguished herself on the hit series Baywatch.
