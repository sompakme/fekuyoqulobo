Every year, the cast of <a href=#>Summer House</a> brings even more drama — and at least one new feud arises.</p><p>The series focuses on several reality TV personalities as they live together for the summer in the Hamptons. The first season originally introduced viewers to <a href=#><strong>Kyle Cooke</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Lindsay Hubbard</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Carl Radke</strong></a>, <strong>Everett Weston</strong>, <strong>Ashley Wirkus</strong>, <strong>Lauren Wirkus</strong> and more when it premiered in 2017.</p><p>As the show gained popularity, new faces eventually joined the Hamptons family, including <a href=#><strong>Amanda Batula</strong></a>, <strong>Daniella Olivera</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Hannah Berner</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Paige DeSorbo</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Luke Gulbranson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ciara Miller</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Mya Allen</strong></a> and more. Over time, the reality show brought in various other Bravolebrities to guest star on the summer series.</p><p>In the fifth season, the format changed to accommodate filming during the COVID-19 pandemic. The cast all lived and quarantined together for a full six weeks and during that time, <a href=#>a physical altercation broke out</a> among the castmates, with crew members being forced to step in to intervene.</p><p>“That was, I think, one of the most traumatic [things I have witnessed]. I know that’s being dramatic, but [there are] traumatic parts about being together,” Danielle told <a href=#>Us Weekly exclusively</a> in February 2021. “Because we don’t leave each other, so much builds up and what is being said or — more so, what is not being said. It all kind of just bottles up and that bubble just really burst. I hated it. It was the worst thing to be around, but we had to deal with it.”</p><p>Danielle later found herself in the middle of a tense feud with Ciara in the sixth season — and things got physical again. Their unexpected feud turned into one of the most shocking moments of the season when Ciara <a href=#>threw her wine glass</a> at the entrepreneur during an Italian-themed dinner.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“After the wine was thrown, she threw the wine glass and it shattered on my chest. I’m like, ‘What the f—k? Like, are you kidding me?’” Danielle <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> in December 2021. “And so, the truth is the next day, I saw bruises — like I had bruises — but Craig, who was there that weekend, he was, like, ‘Oh my God, I pulled you away that hard.’ … No, the bruises were because of that wine glass that she threw at me and shattered on my chest bone. I’m not OK. I’m not OK about it.”</p><p>From lovers’ quarrels to full-on brawls, here’s a look back at some of the biggest Summer House feuds throughout the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXtqizxKyrZqulorqmvoyhpq6rlWKzpsHDrGSorpWnerW0xGawnpmiqHqlsdOaoKWrXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
