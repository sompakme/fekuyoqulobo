While the musician’s romance with Stormi Bree is new, some fans are convinced the couple are about to reach a new milestone – parenthood. A recent photo of Stormy has sparked debate over whether she has a baby bump.</p><p>Earlier this week, Stormi, 33, posted a photo to Instagram but was quick to delete it, leading fans to question why she was so eager to get it off the Internet.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:15</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/the-jonas-brothers-ranked-from-richest-to-poorest-3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Jonas Brothers Ranked From Richest To Poorest</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>From their career as a band to personal projects and enterprises, each Jonas brother has amassed amazing wealth for themselves.</span><h2 id=why-fans-think-joe-rsquo-s-girlfriend-stormi-bree-is-pregnant>Why Fans Think Joe’s Girlfriend Stormi Bree Is Pregnant</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the photo, Stormi’s bare stomach was visible as she held her hands above her head, causing her cropped t-shirt to ride up. The social media personality styled her look with corduroy overalls and a slouchy bag. Stormi posed under a tree while looking off into the corner, but fans couldn’t take their eyes off her midsection.</p><p>Though only a sliver of her stomach was visible, some fans thought they saw a baby bump, which would explain why Stormi was quick to delete it, since she hasn’t made any formal announcement.</p><p>The photo kicked up a storm on Reddit, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many people questioned what they saw</a> .
