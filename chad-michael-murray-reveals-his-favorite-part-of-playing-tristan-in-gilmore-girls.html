The actor described his character, Tristan, to <a href=#>Today</a> as "the kind of guy that you know you shouldn't be around, but you kind of want to be." Murray is well established nowadays, but back then, he appreciated having a recurring role in such a beloved TV show. Aside from loving the writing and cast, Murray pointed to his work opposite Jared Padalecki, who played Rory's boyfriend, Dean, as the best part of the experience.</p><p>Murray reminisced, "These fight sequences where, you know, you're such a jerk, but Jared is, like, the sweetest guy in the whole wide world. And the guy, we get along so well. And we're having it out. And it was always fun for me to be on set and for us to have these scenes where we absolutely despise each other, but yet behind closed doors, you know, offset [sic] like we're just palling around and two goofy kids."</p><p>Sadly, the duo didn't get the opportunity to reunite on the "Gilmore Girls" reboot, since Murray's character was re-cast. The actor told <a href=#>ET</a> he wasn't free when the opportunity came up, but Murray had only good things to say about his replacement. He noted, "Tristan's secret was be that guy that every girl wants to be next to, but just isn't sure they should be, and I heard he did it well."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57l3Jsam9gZLCprcNmpKKbmJayrXnMrqmrmaliv6bCxJqjrGWYnsBussCvpquhpJp6sa3RrWSonl2luaLFyKeeZqyinsC1rc1moKdll565rrvRnmSgoaKhwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
