Kourtney revealed to the audience that she had already once undergone the process 10 years ago and wished to try the same again.</p><p>She explained, “Our last egg retrieval was not successful, so our new thing that we’re going to be trying is a "Panchakarma" cleanse, which is Ayurvedic… It is like 3,000 years old, which will get all the toxins that are deep within our tissue out of our bodies to have better quality eggs."</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#>This Is How Kourtney Kardashian’s Pregnancy Helped Change The ‘KUWTK’ Brand For The Better</a></span></p><p>The socialite also opened up about very strange advice her fertility doc gave her. She revealed having been asked to drink Travis’ semen four times a week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He told us to, well he told me that the thing that would help [my thyroid] was drinking [the fluids] like four times a week,” Kourtney explained, while Travis added that he loves the doctor for the strange yet genuine advice.</p><p>Kourtney and Travis did not just stop at this. The Lemme founder went ahead with vaginal steaming sessions to cleanse her private parts for better odds at pregnancy. In episode 7 of the first season of The Kardashians, Kourtney discussed the entire process with her mother Kris Jenner and sisters <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>.</p><p>She opened up about taking care of her intimate areas and how it would, hopefully, help her get pregnant.</p><p>Comparing this treatment to her previous "Panchakarma" cleanse, Kourtney said, “I did lose 5lbs, but it wasn’t the goal. The goal was to lose all the toxins, and it gives you a clean egg. Then I did a Yoni steam and I want to buy you all a Yoni steam. It’s so good for your vagina, you put roses and stuff in there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/The-Kardashians-scene.jpg><p>Khloe, however, did not seem very enthusiastic about steaming the vagina. The younger Kardashian sister called it “gross” stating that she would not want to put her private parts through the treatment.</p><p>Later, in the third season of Hulu’s The Kardashians, Kourtney and Travis also mentioned their 15-minute intimacy sessions. In the premiere episode, the couple revealed that they have been intimate as much as possible when Kourt is ovulating.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Do Kourtney Kardashian's Kids Really Think Of Travis Barker?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They also excused themselves for “five minutes” while speaking to Khloé Kardashian “to go do something really fast.” Khloé, on the other hand, jokingly timed the couple and revealed that they had taken 15 minutes in total.</p><h2 id=travis-and-kourtney-said-they-were-quitting-ivf>Travis And Kourtney Said They Were Quitting IVF</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kourtney-kardashian-1.jpg><p>Kourtney has also explained how trying to conceive through IVF “hasn’t been the most amazing experience.” For those unversed, IVF, or In Vitro Fertilization is when the eggs are fertilized by the sperm through a culture medium in a laboratory. The fertilized eggs are then transferred to a uterus.</p><p>While Kourtney and Travis considered it as an option, the couple revealed in the premiere episode of season 3 of The Kardashian episodes that the side effects of the treatment outweigh the positives. Kourtney also revealed that she was put “into menopause” due to the triggering effects of the medication.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While speaking to Kris, <a href=#>Kourtney also added how she gained weight due to the procedure</a> which welcomed many unwarranted social media trolling.</p><p>During the heart-to-heart conversation with her mother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney said</a>, “It is so rude to comment on people when you have no idea what they’re going through… The medication that they’ve been giving me, they put me into menopause. Literally into menopause."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All The Kardashian Kids In Order From Oldest To Youngest</a></span></p><p>Kourtney also revealed to have frozen some of her eggs before meeting Travis, but later revealed that they “didn't survive the thaw” and “none of them made it to an embryo.” She also said, “The freezing of the eggs isn't guaranteed. I think that that's a misunderstanding. People do it thinking that it's like a safety net, and it's not.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While adding that they are “officially done with IVF,” Kourtney quipped, “We would love a baby more than anything, but I just really believe in what God has in store for us.

However, acknowledging her daughter’s struggles, Kris said, “Even though Kourtney has three beautiful children, it doesn't make it hurt any less if you're trying to have a baby, and you've been struggling."</p><p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians alum seems to be happy and healthy after announcing her new pregnancy. Kourtney and Travis both have kids from their past relationships, so the new baby will be a welcome addition to the brood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoLy2vtOnnLJlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2owbC8jK6qoqaXYra3soypqZ6fnpa7pMWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
