To ask me to stay and accept it is absolutely insane. The mentality of a narcissist. I will no longer lie to the public or pretend that this is something it isn’t. I choose me, I choose my happiness and health and my respect.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Ne-Yo responded to the allegations&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>via Twitter</a>, requesting that people respect his family’s privacy as they work through their issues.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"For the sake of our children, my family and I will work through our challenges behind closed doors.

I didn’t sign up to do this every day. [I’m] just very multifaceted and that’s where I was at that time, but it became a problem when you want that, you know, a lot. Like, maybe I’ll give you that maybe twice a year…but it was too much.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnGmqSeZaKarqTA0malnrGfYsCpu9abppqsmaO0bsDWqGSlmZSesrR5zqdkr5mTlsGqu81maGtrZG2CeYKUaWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
