Jennifer Lawrence totally transformed her appearance for her new role in the Netflix comedy film Don’t Look Up — but it wasn’t all smooth sailing. 
The 31-year-old actress, who plays an astronomer named Kate Dibiasky, rocked two nose rings during the duration of the filming. And let’s just say it led to some, erm, interesting interactions on set. 
“We kinda decided that Kate is that type to be fierce and ‘notice me, hear me roar, rat-tat-tat’ kind of lady,” the Silver Lining Playbook actress revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The movie, which is about two astronomers that discover a comet is headed toward earth, also stars <a href=#><strong>Meryl Streep</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong> </a>and more.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The Hunger Games actress’ favorite interaction however was with the one and only <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>. In fact, she says that meeting the <a href=# rel=noopener>r.e.m. beauty</a> founder was “one of the coolest days” of her life. “I took a picture with her. I looked like a radio contest winner,” she joked.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Filming with <a href=#><strong>Jonah Hill</strong></a> was also a high point, as it was filled with lots of laughs. “We one time dedicated an entire day to him just improving insults at me.
