Our fictional style icon Blair Waldorf (portrayed flawlessly by Leighton Meester on Gossip Girl, which ran for six seasons from 2007 to 2012) once said, “Whoever said money doesn’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop.” As a shopping expert who’s well-aware that knowing where to shop for your favorite pieces can bring you great joy, I’d have to agree with her on that sentiment."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The daughter of wealthy socialite and fashion designer Eleanor Waldorf, Blair certainly knew where to shop and has inspired many of Us with her style.</p><p>Whether she was dressed by her mom or herself, Blair was always polished to perfection. Her style was a mix of feminine, preppy, elegant, sophisticated and even sometimes spicy – very much in line with her personality. And while the clothing the affluent teenager rocked on the regular was undoubtedly expensive, we gathered up 17 fashion pieces for much, much less to get the timeless BW look.

In Full Bloom:</strong> Made with an off-the-shoulder design, a ruched bodice and floral appliqué on the chest, we can see Blair wearing <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a top like this</a> on a New York night getting drinks with the girls.</p><p><strong>10. Sophisticated Satchel:</strong> Much like Blair’s personality, this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">top-handle bag</a> features an edgy croc print but boasts a sophisticated and timeless design.</p><p><strong>11.
