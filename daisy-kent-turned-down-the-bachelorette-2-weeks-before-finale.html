“I was very open and honest about it and very transparent that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to do it but like two weeks before [AFTR I had decided],” Daisy, 25, said during the Thursday, April 4, episode of “The Viall Files” podcast. “They were all super nice and respectful and understood all my reasons."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They still want to see me grow and said, ‘If we can help you in any way, we want to.’”</p><p class=p1>Daisy was one of <strong>Joey Graziadei</strong>’s final two women and <a href=#>opted to break up</a> with him in the finale — which was filmed in November 2023 — after she realized that <strong>Kelsey Anderson</strong> was “his person.” (Joey, 28, proposed to Kelsey, 25, moments after Daisy’s breakup. They are still together.)</p><p class=p1>After Daisy left <i>The Bachelor</i>, she began talks with producers about becoming the franchise’s next lead. During <i>AFTR </i>in March, she publicly declined the role.</p><p class=p1>“There’s, like, a few reasons. One is my health is an aspect of it and I knew as the lead, it’s a lot on you — not only emotionally but also physically.” Daisy, who is deaf and <a href=#>has a cochlear implant</a>, explained on Thursday. “You’re up super late, it’s nonstop and I talked to a lot of past leads when [the show] was in talks with me and I just knew from a health point it would be a lot.”</p><p class=p1>Daisy also admitted that she “wasn’t ready for that specific thing,” seemingly referring to the commitment of getting engaged at the end of the season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Daisy-Kent-Breaks-Down-When-She-Turned-Down-The-Bachelorette-Offer-4.jpg><p class=p1>“I think coming off the show and doing the show, I didn’t realize how much of a big thing it is,” Daisy said. “I think right now I just want to live and be happy. I’m always gonna jump for opportunities but I just think this specific opportunity wasn’t right for me right now.”</p><p class=p1>Daisy further stressed that she was concerned about “hurting other people” during the season.</p><p class=p1>“There’s around 30 people and, like, you can’t send everyone home at once. What if I didn’t actually like them?” she explained. “I don’t think I could sit there and kiss someone and you know what I mean? So, I thought really long and hard about all of it. It wasn’t an easy decision. I was wondering, like, after it got announced how I would feel … but I’m, like, so happy right now that I didn’t. So, it feels good [and] like I made the right decision for me.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Feature-Daisy-Kent-Breaks-Down-When-She-Turned-Down-The-Bachelorette-Offer.jpg><p class=p1>Daisy also had “a lot of conversations” with her family members and multiple past Bachelor Nation leads before making her final decision.</p><p>“Everyone was like, ‘It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done,’ but a lot of people were like, ‘It’s also the best thing too,’ and no one regretted it,” she said. “But [they said], ‘If [you’re] doing it, make sure you’re ready.’ It didn’t feel right.”</p><p class=p2>After Daisy turned down <i>The Bachelorette</i>, they offered the mantle to <strong>Jenn Tran</strong>. Her season is <a href=#>currently filming</a>, which Daisy is “so excited” to watch.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuaoaOueqyxza1kra2io7KlecOorqdlpJ2ybq7AnJ%2BepJ%2BnsrXAxGZpZq%2BVmri0ecGenaiqlWKzqrrApZxo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
