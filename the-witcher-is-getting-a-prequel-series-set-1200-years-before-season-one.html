Shows it creates that can't be seen anywhere else. Orange Is The New Black, GLOW, and Dead To Me, just to name a few. However, according to Netflix, its most popular original so far has been The Witcher.</p><p>The show, which is based on The Witcher series of books and games, stars <a href=#>Henry Cavill</a> and aired on Netflix in 2019. According to Netflix, around 76 million people have watched The Witcher making it one of, if not the most popular first season of a show in the streaming service's history. With that in mind, it would make sense that Netflix wants to capitalize on that popularity as much as possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Season 2 Of The Witcher Will Not Feature Multiple Timelines</a></span></p><p>It will do that in a number of ways. Most obviously, via a second season of The Witcher. Production has begun on the follow-up season and will resume midway through August after being forced to pause due to the pandemic. There's also an animated Witcher movie coming to the platform. Plus, on top of all that, Netflix revealed this week that a prequel series is in the works.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The six-part limited series will be called The Witcher: Blood Origin and will take place 1200 years before the events of season one. Sorry Cavill fans, that means there will be no appearances from the Witcher we know and love. Instead, the series will track how Geralt's kind came to be and show how the very first Witcher&nbsp;came into the world.</p><p>No word yet on when Blood Origin will hit Netflix or who will appear on the show. However, the writer of season one will be its showrunner. As well as exploring the story of the very first Witcher, Blood Origin will also tell the tale of how the elven world fell&nbsp;and detail the arrival of humans. Chances are it will be a must-see for Witcher fans, but also very different from what they are familiar with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Andy Samberg Addresses And Assesses The Future Of Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWivmamwqbHRZpmlp5%2BZerC%2ByKCgp2WemsGnuMixZKmqlabCpriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
