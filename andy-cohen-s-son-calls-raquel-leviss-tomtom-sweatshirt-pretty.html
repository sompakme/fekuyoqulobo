Cohen <a href=#>received the TomTom merchandise as a gift from Leviss</a>, 28, during her March appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.</p><p>Shortly after teasing her past hookup with <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz</strong></a> on the show, Leviss made headlines when <a href=#>news broke days later about her affair</a> with Schwartz’s business partner <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>. The Missouri native, 40, called it quits with <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> after nearly a decade of dating due to the infidelity.</p><p>Cohen, for his part, took to social media to poke fun at the <a href=#>new meaning behind the TomTom sweatshirt</a>. As fans remember, the former beauty pageant contestant<a href=#> wore the merch at BravoCon in October 2022</a> amid her secret romance with Sandoval. Eagle-eyed followers also pointed out that Sandoval <a href=#>dressed up as Leviss in the sweatshirt for Halloween</a> that same month.</p><p>“Just to say, I’m as riveted and upset and thinking about this Scandoval as all of you,” Cohen said during an Instagram Story on March 4. “I’m now wondering, does this sweatshirt hold all the answers to our questions? What does this sweatshirt know? What has it seen? What stories can it tell? It’s just sitting here kind of reverberating. I don’t know. I need answers, sweatshirt. Talk to me.”</p><p>Amid the drama, Leviss <a href=#>issued a public apology to Madix</a>. “I want to apologize for my actions and my choices foremost to Ariana, and to my friends and the fans so invested in our relationships. There is no excuse, I am not a victim and I must own my actions and I deeply regret hurting Ariana,” she wrote via Instagram on March 8.</p><p>The California native said <a href=#>she was “speaking to a counselor” about her personal issues</a>, adding, “I have sought emotional validation through intimate connections that are not healthy without regard for my own well-being, sometimes negatively affecting others and often prioritizing the intimate connection over my friendships. I am taking steps to understand my behavior and make healthier choices.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Sandoval — who also apologized to his ex — has since<a href=#> defended his choices by claiming he tried to call it quits</a> with Madix, 37, in the past.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Obviously, she was very upset. She freaking punched me and all this s–t,” he alleged on the Tuesday, April 11, episode of the “Howie Mandel Does Stuff” podcast about their split. “A couple days later, I sit down and talk with her again, and she’s like, ‘I’m not letting you leave me. You’re gonna have to me force me out of this relationship.'”</p><p>The Schwartz and Sandy’s cofounder also <a href=#>clarified where he and Leviss stand now</a>, saying, “We’re really good friends. We are not putting any label on it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaappSueqS7x56lrGWjpLtur8Clo6xlopa%2BtrHLZqOerpmowG7AzqarqKVdqMSmrdOsn6KqpGK9s7HTrbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
