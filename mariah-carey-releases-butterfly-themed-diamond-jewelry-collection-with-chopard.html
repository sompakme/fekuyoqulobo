Photos from the event show Mariah and Caroline posing with the stunning diamond pieces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The collaboration features a variety of diamond-paved pieces, including a necklace, earrings, and a ring made from Fairmined-certified ethical gold.</p><p>The jewelry (which comes in gold and silver varieties) has a high price-tag to reflect its quality. The butterfly ring goes for $11,900 USD, while the necklace is $13,300. But the priciest piece in the collection are the butterfly earrings, which retail on Chopard’s website for $23,500.</p><p>As for what the collection means to her, Mariah recently told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, “When we first started talking about partnering, 'All I Want For Christmas' was about to receive a diamond certification, so I thought they'd want to do something Christmas-y."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah continued, “Then, the Chopard team stated the obvious — the butterfly. It also made sense because this year is the 25th anniversary of Butterfly, which is my most personal album.”</p><p>“It's the body of work that I'm the most proud of as an artist, a producer and a writer. So, it was just sort of kismet,” she concluded.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Travis Barker Releases New CBD Skincare, But It’s Causing Controversy</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Chopard</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8yaqaKZmGKwor7EsmSrnZyarrSx0maZrqykmr%2BnuNhmq6GdnZqxbrDImqSoppRit6bDxKWpsmWTpLmtscKtoKimXay2tbSMnJ%2BoqJGnsXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
