In fact, one star has apparently built a higher net worth than Lovato has, in an altogether separate career path.</p><p>Many of the names from 'Sonny with a Chance' aren't that recognizable these days, but that doesn't mean they haven't branched out and built their own following apart from Demi. So who is Brandon Mychal Smith, and how did he get so rich?</p><h2 id=demi-lovato-39-s-former-co-star-has-been-busy>Demi Lovato's Former Co-Star Has Been Busy</h2><p>Though 'Sonny with a Chance' was an iconic time in many Disney kid viewers' lives, it only lasted two years. Then, the spinoff 'So Random!' lasted another year, and then it was all over. So after a few years of playing the role of Nico Harris, what did Brandon Mychal Smith do next?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sonny With A Chance: What Most Fans Don't Know About The Show</a></span></p><p>As it turns out, quite a lot. While <a href=#>Demi's former on-screen boyfriend</a> didn't stay in the spotlight too much, Brandon seemed to seek it out.</p><p>Credited as Brandon Smith, the actor went on to appear in a handful of films immediately following his Disney departure. He's also had various gigs on different TV series (six, in fact), and voiced one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mikey, to be specific).</p><p>2021 is also shaping up to be a busy year for Brandon Mychal Smith, even though 'Sonny with a Chance' is now far behind him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-brandon-mychal-smith-get-his-start>How Did Brandon Mychal Smith Get His Start?</h2><p>Even before Brandon Mychal Smith appeared on 'Sonny with a Chance' with his fellow Disney alums, he had plenty going for him professionally. According to his IMDb <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a>, Smith was even in 1999's 'She's All That'; his first acting credit was as "JV Cleaning Boy."</p><p>But after that, things picked up. Brandon had a recurring role on 'Unfabulous,' appeared on handful of other TV series (including 'That's So Raven'), and then had a recurring role on 'Phil of the Future.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Disney Channel’s Skai Jackson Made Her Impressive Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's even more interesting about Brandon Mychal Smith's career pre-'Sonny' is that he appeared in one of Demi Lovato's early music videos. Then, of course, he became Nico Harris on 'Sonny with a Chance,' and the rest is history.</p><h2 id=what-is-brandon-mychal-smith-39-s-net-worth>What Is Brandon Mychal Smith's Net Worth?</h2><p>His resume doesn't seem crazy illustrious, but it's clear that Brandon Mychal Smith has been pretty busy since leaving 'Sonny with a Chance.' But how could he be compared to Demi Lovato in terms of financial success? It's not quite clear, actually.</p><p>Multiple sources claim that Brandon Mychal Smith's net worth far exceeds that of Demi Lovato. While <a href=#>Demi has apparently been worth about $40M</a> for some time now, Brandon Mychal Smith might be worth six times as much.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Dating Demi Lovato Help Increase Max Ehrich's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>Sure, some sources estimate lower, stating that Brandon's net worth is somewhere between $4.8M and $6M. But various other figures are circulating online, too; one source says Smith is worth <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$125.8 million</a>, while another suggests he's worth an impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$245 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And although a lot of sources like to throw numbers around, no one seems to know exactly how Smith is making his money. However, there seem to be rumors that he owns a company, especially since his social media handles all include "CEO."</p><h2 id=what-does-brandon-mychal-smith-do-now>What Does Brandon Mychal Smith Do Now?</h2><p>Brandon Mychal Smith definitely still acts; he has multiple projects coming out in 2021 and 2022. Of course, his Wikipedia entry also details the fact that he's a singer, dancer, and rapper in addition to being an actor. Plus, he produced a song for a music group, so it seems he does dabble in the management side of music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet the long list of acting gigs he's taken on could also have amounted to the many millions he's apparently earned; Smith has had some high-profile gigs, like portraying Little Richard in 'Get on Up' alongside Chadwick Boseman.</p><p>Whether or not he's truly worth hundreds of millions of dollars is up for debate, but it's clear that the former 'Sonny with a Chance' star has done big things with his life. And it doesn't seem that the former teen TV star is done going places yet.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Of The Top Disney Channel Stars Of The Past Decade, Who Is The Richest?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqqKaernq4tdOhZJplk52ur6%2FEZqqtmaJitaqzx56pZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2asmJa7brDEpqBmpJ%2BrrrW7jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
