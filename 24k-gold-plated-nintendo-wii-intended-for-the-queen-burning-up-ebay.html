That's right, the console originally made for her royal highness can be yours to keep and cherish... if you're ready to dish out that much money for it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gold In Goop: Why Gwyneth Paltrow Built Her Million-Dollar Wellness Empire</a></span></p><p>All it took was one fleeting moment during which time the Queen confessed that she enjoyed playing Nintendo Wii Sports Bowling. Everything happened pretty quickly from that point forward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seeing an opportunity to create something truly magical and make history in the process, gaming website THQ Nordic quickly took action and seized the moment by creating a console that would truly be fit for the Queen.</p><p>A team immediately began creating ideas about what sort of unique elements could be added to the console to make it superior and more desirable to the Royal Family.</p><p>The finished product was the ultimate creation of a 24-carat console that is literally worth its weight in gold.</p><p>Most people&nbsp;would think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">everything is better when it's made of gold</a>. Unfortunately, after this incredible idea was put in motion and the pure-gold console was created, Buckingham Palace rejected the offer and refused to accept <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the very expensive gaming console.</a></p><p>A man by the name of Fillerup now has the console in his possession. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC,</a> "Fillerup, 32, said experts have valued the console at up to $1 million. He lives in the Netherlands and runs an online console database called Console Variations."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's not asking for quite that much money though. In fact, he's willing to let the unit go for way under the valuation costs. $300,000 will be the sweet spot for Fillerup, who desires to purchase his own home with the funds generated from this sale.</p><p>Although it would be truly historic to won a gold Nintendo Wii that was legitimately created for the Queen, most people aren't willing to spend that kind of money on the unit.</p><p>If the idea still appeals to you, there are other, more crafty ways to own a gold-plated Wii. There are a series of lightly gold-plated units that are now for sale all over the internet for $500 or less, making it far more accessible to the general public.</p><p>The Queen said no, but for many other shoppers, a gold-plated Wii is a definite "yes"!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Nice Cities In Europe Where You Can Live Like Royalty On A Low Wage</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Star</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2BtrHEp2SepJmvrqOx06Fka2ybYrSwuMNmpaKmpJq7pbuMsKCiZZWXrrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
