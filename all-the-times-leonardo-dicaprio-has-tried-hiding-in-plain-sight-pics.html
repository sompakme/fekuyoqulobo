Leonardo DiCaprio’s A-list status has naturally caused him to want to keep to himself — but he’s not always successful.
Understandably, someone of DiCaprio’s prestige, a sought-after movie star with seven Academy Award nominations and one win under his belt, is a person of public interest. His romantic relationships, friendships and beyond have garnered an abundance of headlines, but he’s less than interested in having his entire life up for public display."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His <a href=#><span>romantic relationships</span></a><span>, </span><a href=#><span>friendships</span></a> and beyond have garnered an abundance of headlines, but he’s less than interested in having his entire life up for public display.</p><p>Over the years, <a href=#>the Revenant actor</a> has utilized very unique methods to hide from the paparazzi while in public through the years. When he attended a Los Angeles Lakers game in 2019, he opted to wear black sunglasses beneath a blue Los Angeles Dodgers hat while indoors. A decade earlier, the acclaimed actor ducked down in a London taxicab while covering most of his face with a black hoodie.</p><p>During <a href=#>the coronavirus pandemic</a> in 2021, he added a mask to his list of clothing items that could obscure his famous face while vacationing in Hawaii with his longtime girlfriend, actress <a href=#><strong>Camila Morrone</strong></a>, who he began dating in 2017. (Us Weekly confirmed in August 2022 <a href=#>they split after four years together.</a>)</p><p>However, no matter what clever disguises the <a href=#><i>Romeo + Juliet</i> actor</a> wears, fans always seem to be able to spot him from a mile away. For DiCaprio, that loss of anonymity is one of the downsides of fame.</p><p>DiCaprio has not shied away from sharing the downsides of fame. In an <a href=#>Esquire</a> profile in 2016, the Wolf of Wall Street star opened up about gaining recognition early in his career.</p><p>“I really didn’t understand what fame was and I didn’t understand what being in a giant hit was, and I didn’t understand <a href=#><span>what a giant hit </span><i><span>Titanic</span></i><span> was</span></a> compared to other giant hits,” he said at the time. “There was no rule book. There was nobody to navigate me through the experience of being watched all the time and nobody to tell me how to be normal when everybody is acting and looking at me differently.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Django Unchained actor added, “Look, if you’re not careful about it, it can develop into a social anxiety. It’s like, what’s going to happen, what photographer is going to jump out where, what kind of thing am I being set up for? You try to talk yourself out of it, but you’re never used to it.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see all of the times DiCaprio tried to hide in plain sight — but failed miserably.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkrq24jK2fnmWknrqmv4ylnKimkaexsHnDopqaqKKevG60wKxkraqZmrFutMidoKefXZ67brzLmqCnZaOetKnAjKmgnKtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
