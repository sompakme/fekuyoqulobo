But she hasn’t always been. The ‘80s fitness icon battled eating disorders for much of her adult life&nbsp;— and believes her emotionally abusive dad, the late, legendary actor Henry Fonda, planted the seed. “When I hit adolescence and the specter of womanhood loomed, all that mattered was how I looked and fit in,” the <i>Grace and Frankie</i> actress wrote in the March 23 <a href=#><i>Lenny</i> newsletter</a>. “My father would send my stepmother to tell me to lose weight and wear longer skirts. One of my stepmothers told me all the ways I’d have to change physically if I wanted a boyfriend.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>Fonda was 12 when her mother, </span><span>Frances Ford Seymour</span><span>, c</span><span>ommitted </span><span>suicide. Soon after, Fonda began struggling with bulimia — sometimes purging up to 20 times a day.&nbsp;</span><span>This went on until she was 35. “Like three of my father’s five wives, I developed an eating disorder (probably to fill the emptiness),” she explained.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Oscar winner previously opened up about her unhappy childhood to <i>Harpers Bazaar</i> in 2011. “I was raised in the ‘50s,” she said. “I was taught by my father that how I looked was all that mattered. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you’re not going to be loved.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Fonda has also addressed her plastic surgery. “I’m not proud of that fact that I’ve had it,” she admitted to <i>W </i>Magazine in 2015. “But I grew up so defined by my looks. I was taught to think if I wanted to be loved, I had to be thin and pretty. That leads to a lot of trouble.”</p><p>After three failed marriages to screenwriter <b>Roger Vadim</b>, political activist <b>Tom Hayden</b> and media mogul <b>Ted Turner,</b> Fonda (who has three children) is finally comfortable in her skin.“When I turned 60 and entered my third and final act, I decided that no matter how scary it was, I needed to heal the wounds that patriarchy had dealt me,” she wrote in the <i>Lenny</i> newsletter. “I didn’t want to come to the end of my life without doing all I could to become a whole, full-voiced woman.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ6aeqe7zZ2YZqWpYrOiwMeeqWaglaO%2FunnFqKWdmV2irqWxjKacZpqlobautcJmrmtoYmd9cXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
