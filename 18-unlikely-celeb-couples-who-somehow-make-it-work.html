When finding a significant other, some lean more toward&nbsp;outer beauty&nbsp;while others lean more toward inner beauty. In this list of celebrities, we will take a look at those who look past what’s on the outside and focus on what’s on the inside. Everyone looks at couples like Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds and&nbsp;categorizes&nbsp;them&nbsp;as relationship goals, but how many Blake Livelys&nbsp;and Ryan Reynolds are there in the world? This list shows us that you don’t have to be a supermodel to be super happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of these celebrities have been with their significant other for over a decade and they are happier than ever. There is no shame when love is involved and although they may have made this list they're still very much in love. When you think of celebrity couples, most of them consist of two celebrities who met on set and started a whirlwind romance, much like Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan-Tatum. Hollywood may have its pick of some of the most beautiful people, but not everyone wants to take a pick from the pond they swim around when they're working.</p><h2 id=aaron-taylor-johnson-and-sam-taylor-wood><strong>Aaron Taylor-Johnson And Sam Taylor-Wood</strong></h2><p>Some would say the 24-year age gap could play a factor in this relationship, but&nbsp;Johnson and Taylor-Wood got married in 2012 and have been in love ever since. The English actor and English filmmaker have two children together, Wylda and Romy, but Taylor-Wood also has two other children, Angelica and Jessie, from a previous marriage that ended in 2008. The Avengers star gets constant probing questions about how they make their marriage work with their age&nbsp;difference and he said in an interview with Elle that he has learned to shrug it off even though he knows&nbsp;the questions&nbsp;won’t end. The director is best known for her breakout movie Nowhere Boy, which they both worked on together. The Kick Ass star has picked up more roles as he has been appeared as Quicksilver in&nbsp;Avengers: Age of Ultron. The couple did start their whirlwind romance on the set of Nowhere Boy and&nbsp;later that year, they were engaged to be married when he was only 19 at the time. Most people would hesitate, especially with the looming age gap, but in an interview with Time, Taylor-Johnson said,&nbsp;“I knew I wanted to be with her. I wanted kids, we had kids and I was really into that, taking time off and involving myself in the bubble of her pregnancy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-tamblyn-and-david-cross><strong>Amber Tamblyn And David Cross</strong></h2><p>Despite the controversy that was brought to the public’s attention last year, Amber Tamblyn and David Cross are still going strong. The Saturn Award winner was born in 1983 in Santa Monica on the opposite coast of comedic husband who was born in Atlanta 19 years before. The couple wed in 2012 and have one daughter. The pair are an odd couple, not only because of the age gap, but also because, although the series actor has a higher net worth than the Californian beauty, she has higher ranks when it comes to the Hollywood scale of attractiveness. The two met at the airport on a connecting flight from Houston to Louisiana and bonded over the Sky Mall magazine. Although you may recognize both of these celebs, would you have grouped them together for the long haul? The two make it a point to make their age difference a joke despite what Hollywood has to say about it. The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants actress was a fan of Cross before meeting him, so he confessed to an audience at Running Late with Scott Rogowsky that he “was slow to make any moves because of&nbsp;[their] age difference, and also because she was a fan.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cate-blanchett-and-andrew-upton><strong>Cate Blanchett and Andrew Upton</strong></h2><p>Actress Cate Blanchett and director Andrew Upton have been an official item since 1997. The pair of Australians have four children together. The Oceans 8 actress began her career in the early '90s before she was thrown in a whirlwind romance with her director husband. As one would hope, they met on the set of a TV show in 1996 when she thought of him too be “arrogant.” A Hollywood movie with a twist, the Stories of Lost Souls producer was not attracted to her either. Funny enough, they hit it off over a game of poker. The Oscar winner told Ellen she knew after three days that she wanted to marry Upton, but it took him 21 days to actually ask. The Blue Jasmine star joked about giving Carol producer food poisoning to hook him for life. Who knew a little food poisoning was the real way to get a marriage proposal? Cate Blanchett has two Oscars and over 180 nominations compared to Australian husband's one nomination. Although he may be used to being cropped out of photos and not being in the public eye, he doesn’t seem to mind as he confessed, "I'm never followed but Cate is. Her public identity is very associated with her work, which I think is good, right and proper because she's bloody good at it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-and-stedman-graham><strong>Oprah Winfrey and Stedman Graham</strong></h2><p>The definition of when you have an outstanding partner and you are a major supporting key role describes the relationship between Oprah Winfrey and longtime boyfriend Stedman Graham. You can’t mention the mogul without thinking about her biggest supporter Graham. Winfrey was born in 1954 in Mississippi and has become a great rags-to-riches story that inspires many. She&nbsp;met&nbsp;Stedman in 1986 at a charity event in Chicago. Since then, the two have been engaged but called it off.&nbsp;They have since continued their romantic relationship with one another, however. The net worth of the media mogul racks up to $2.8 billion. Although the business keeps him busy, he's only has racked up $10 million of net worth. I know numbers don’t lie, but even though he may not be up to par on paper, graduating from Hard-Simmons University and running his own management and consulting firm based in Chicago, he is still the underdog in this relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-hendricks-and-geoffrey-arend><strong>Christina Hendricks and Geoffrey Arend</strong></h2><p>This&nbsp;gorgeous star has graced our screens and hearts since the late '90s. Christina Hendricks tied the knot with New Yorker Geoffrey Arend.&nbsp;Hendricks&nbsp;hung up her bachelorette hat for good in 2009 after meeting the series actor on the set of Mad Men. This was love at first sight for her. The moment she met him, she admitted to being drawn to him. It took them two years to wed and although she mentioned on their first date that she wanted to have a family, they have since then come to the conclusion they did not want children.&nbsp;When it comes&nbsp;to the media declaring Hendricks as a total bombshell, she says her husband has been saying it since the beginning. "Whenever we see something about it, he always says, 'I told you from the beginning. I’m the one who called it first.' So he just wants a little credit. Really, he’s sweet and he’s happy for me.” Although many would say Arend is out Hendricks’ league she&nbsp;says, “He [was] just charming, funny and very magnetic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rooney-mara-and-joaquin-phoenix><strong>Rooney Mara and Joaquin Phoenix</strong></h2><p>They may not have taken the next step in their relationship, but Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara are a couple to point out. Their 9-year age gap is the least awkward of their relationship. The couple met on the set of film Her where they played exes. This epic romance started with an epic disaster, but at least it was only for the big screen. The two have kept their whirlwind romance away from the public eye by only letting us know they are officially together by showing up at events and locking lips. Since the Pan actress has put her house on the market it has been speculated that&nbsp;she and longtime boyfriend are getting more serious. Mara lives a reclusive lifestyle and&nbsp;Pheonix seems to agree with her seclusion. Friends close to the couple have claimed they are perfect for each other because they are both "shy homebodies" and "meant for each other." While he has a questionable reputation, if there's one thing they do have in common, is their fascination with unique and controversial roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=salma-hayek-and-francois-henri-pinault><strong>Salma Hayek And Francois-Henri Pinault</strong></h2><p>Who said America doesn’t bring people together? Mexican goddess and actress Salma Hayek married French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault in 2009. They met in 2006 and dated for 11 months before getting engaged the following year when they also announced their pregnancy with daughter Valentina. Although the Oscar winner may have snatched this wealthy business man off the market, he is no stranger to dating women outside of his market. His ex-girlfriend and mother of one of his children, Linda Evangelista, was a super model from Canada.&nbsp;Hayek&nbsp;may be the looker in this relationship, without question,&nbsp;but when it comes down to financial matters, the billionaire businessman will be picking up the check. I guess in a way, this makes them the perfect match for each other.</p><p><strong>"A good marriage, full of love, is my biggest accomplishment. Home is where my husband is,"</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>she continues. "He is home. Everything outside of the family nucleus is an adventure that you're living together."</p><h2 id=anne-hathaway-and-adam-shulman><strong>Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman</strong></h2><p>The Bride Wars star met her husband of six years in 2008 at the Palms Springs Film Festival through mutual friends. Hathaway knew from the beginning that she would marry Shulman. She&nbsp;may be supported by her jewelry designer husband, but she has made it clear that if she had things her way, she would be married to Emily Blunt instead. Despite her massive celebrity crush on Blunt, in an interview with People, the Oscar winner talks about her marriage and confessed,</p><p><strong>“He changed my ability to be in the world comfortably. I think the accepted narrative now is that we, as women, don’t need anybody.</strong></p><p>But I need my husband. His unique and specific love has changed me."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keira-knightley-and-james-righton><strong>Keira Knightley and James Righton</strong></h2><p>Keira Knightley and musician James Righton made it legally official in 2013, sealing the deal with a beautiful baby girl Edie. The pair met at a party after having a few drinks, which is pretty hilarious, because how often does that kind of thing happen? Although her rock-star husband was&nbsp;well known all over Britain, when he finally met Knightley,&nbsp;she said she “never heard of [them].” Once&nbsp;they started dating, she went their shows and became a bigger fan of his music and falling in love with "Surfing the Void." Despite the fact that the musician went through a hard time at one point, Knightley stuck by him.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-and-michel-stern><strong>Lisa Kudrow and Michel Stern</strong></h2><p>In what I would call a lifelong romance, Lisa Kudrow and soulmate Michel Stern wed in 1995 and have been one of the longest-lasting couples in Hollywood. Even though Stern was in a relationship with her then-roommate when they first met, he did not make a move on the Friends actress until six years later. The French marketer was able to sweep&nbsp;Kudrow off her feet despite being a French immigrant who previously dated her roommate. Although for Kudrow, it was love at first sight. “When Michel and I decided to get married, we understood: We're not promising to love each other forever because you can't do that, but we are promising to work on whatever problems come up.” Stern has been a supportive role in Kudrow’s life, but they both have come to terms that maintaining their independence within their relationship is a big factor in their long-lasting relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=isla-fisher-and-sacha-cohen><strong>Isla Fisher and Sacha Cohen</strong></h2><p>Isla Fisher, not to be confused with Amy Adams, was taken off the market by comedian beau Sacha Cohen in 2010. After meeting in 2002 at a party in Australia, they immediately fell in love and were engaged two years later. They had a long engagement, the kind you think they won’t make it past, but in 2010, they finally tied the knot and the next year, started growing their family. When you think of them as a couple, you see a small fireball actress and a tall, lanky, goofy guy. Despite their obvious differences, the couple continues to gush over each other. When Fisher opened up about her marriage to HELLO!,&nbsp;she&nbsp;said,</p><p><strong>"Life is filled with highs and lows, and you have a best friend to share it with you. It's amazing. It's like winning the lottery, having a good partner."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having a 6-year engagement, the Bruno star finally got the&nbsp;Fisher to walk down the aisle.&nbsp;She has a new project coming out this summer, a movie called Tag, while&nbsp;Cohen is rumored to be starring in an unnamed project directed by Michael Winterbottom.</p><h2 id=natalia-dyer-and-charlie-heaton><strong>Natalia Dyer and Charlie Heaton</strong></h2><p>Many actors meet and fall in love on set, and for the lucky ones, their strong chemistry is reflected on the screen, giving us award-winning acting. This is the case with&nbsp;Stranger Things co-stars Dyer and Heaton. While Dyer plays the pretty teen in the show, Heaton is the awkward, geeky kid in high school who's always had a crush on Miss Popular. And just like in real life, Heaton won her over.&nbsp;When asked how she felts about her co-star, she commented that he was "great and talented," but she followed it up by praising her other cast members. Although this relationship is fairly new, we can't help but root for them. And it doesn’t hurt that that their on-screen chemistry only makes their off-screen chemistry more desirable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christina-aguilera-and-matt-rutler><strong>Christina Aguilera and Matt Rutler</strong></h2><p>Singing sensation Christina Aguilera recently got engaged to longtime boyfriend Matt Rutler. The couple have been dating since 2010 and got engaged on Valentine’s Day. According to the singer,</p><p><strong>“He's the kind of person you could spend hours on the phone talking to and all of a sudden it's daylight.”</strong></p><p>Despite being married, when they initially met, the problems in her marriage with Jordan Bratman had been swirling all over Hollywood blogs for months. Friends before lovers is a policy&nbsp;she followed when getting close to fiancé. When they met on the set of Burlesque, the production assistant was constantly by her side&nbsp;and she admits to starting a friendship with him. The Grammy winner confessed to People, “Once I filed for divorce, we started dating. I'm not trying to jump into anything. I [had] just left my 5-year marriage."&nbsp;The two have not set a date yet. Here's hoping they'll make it down the aisle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-and-benji-madden><strong>Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden</strong></h2><p>Cameron Diaz is a heartbreaker and has been off the market the last three years, officially at least. The lucky guy is Benji Madden who is a guitarist and singer for two bands, Good Charlotte and The Madden Brothers. Standing three inches taller than her musical beau, she still admires her husband as she gushed that,</p><p><strong>“No one compares. Everything else just like washes and slips away."</strong></p><p>The two officially met after his brother, Joel Madden and wife, Nicole Richie invited him to Diaz’s dinner party. They were instantly attracted to each other and have been inseparable since. The talented pair have recently announced they are expecting their first child together. They are known to keep their private life separated from their careers and have been successful at it thus far.&nbsp;Diaz wed the guitarist in her living room with only a few friends, followed by a backyard after party.&nbsp;She said she&nbsp;knew it was love at first sight. "You just know when you know. Like you're my husband." The 45-year-old actress said she has officially retired from acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-and-olivier-sarkozy><strong>Mary Kate Olsen and Olivier Sarkozy</strong></h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen, 31, wed Olivier Sarkozy, 49, in 2015 after dating for 3 years. The French banker is head-over-heels in love with the Olsen twin. They may not have children together, but the fashion designer&nbsp;took on two&nbsp;children&nbsp;from her French husband and his previous marriage. She still finds happiness with her husband and stepchildren and when asked about her marriage, the New York Minute actress confessed,</p><p><strong>“I think we’re lucky. [Working hard] comes quite naturally for us. We don’t need so much time to sit and think and ponder.”</strong></p><p>Everything wasn’t always&nbsp;easy at the beginning of their relationship considering ex-wife Charlotte made it public with how unhappy she was with the age gap between the pair. Between his ex and the media, no one deterred the couple from finding their happily ever after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meryl-streep-and-don-gummer><strong>Meryl Streep and Don Gummer</strong></h2><p>Meryl Streep, 68, has been married to Don Gummer, 71, for 40 years. Everyone who has eyes, ears, and mouths have at the very least heard of Streep. She is reported by several outlets to be the best actress of her generation. Gummer and Streep met in 1978 after John Cazale passed away from lung cancer and she needed a place to stay. So Gummer came to the rescue and lent her his apartment. They have been inseparable since their meeting. They got married later that year despite Cazale and Streep’s relationship before his passing. She said in an interview that she had “never gotten over John's death.” Gummer is a sculptor and although he may not be as well-known as Meryl Streep, he is still considered to be a successful artist. Streep has a net worth of reportedly $90 million while husband Gummer is worth about $10 million. Not quite equally matched financially, but the Oscar winner describes him as “the linchpin” of her life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tina-fey-and-jeff-richmond><strong>Tina Fey and Jeff Richmond</strong></h2><p>After 7 years of dating and falling in love, Tina Fey and Jeff Richmond finally tied the knot in 2001. Fey was born in Pennsylvania and met her Ohio-born producer when they worked at The Second City in Chicago. They then both moved on to SNL and when asked how she felt about working with her husband, the 30 Rock actress said, “I think we compliment each other nicely because we’re not in the same room all day.” The comedian is worth roughly $45 million while her husband stands at $3 million. Although this couple isn’t the social normal of what you imagine celebrity couples to be, Richmond claims he “fell in love with her very quickly. She has this caustic biting wit that pops out occasionally but she really does have a little-girl-from-the-suburbs kind of ambience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=holly-willoughby-and-dan-baldwin><strong>Holly Willoughby and Dan Baldwin</strong></h2><p>When photos of model and television presenter Holly Willoughby and her husband Daniel Baldwin surfaced on the Internet, there were many shocked faced to say the least. The underwear model wed the love of her life in 2007 and they have three children. Producer husband swept the presenter off her feet when they first met working on the CITV show Ministry of Mayhem in 2004, but it was not love at first sight. Love may be in the eye of the beholder, but Willoughby had to warm up to Baldwin before they finally settled down.</p><p><strong>“I didn’t fancy Dan at all, I didn’t even think about it,”</strong></p><p>the model recalled when in an interview with Closer. The best-selling author has a children’s book series while her hubby is working as a development executive for Talkback Thames. The couple is open about the hardships in their marriage and the TV host admits that being married "isn’t always easy." For those who think looks are everything, this couple is a shining example of how a model fell in love with a producer. Despite their financial differences, they have made their love work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>References: people.com, tmz.com, enews.com, glamour.com, hellocanada.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6trrLoqKepKlisKa4xJtknKelpbmmv4ywn6hlo6S6prTOsGSmmZuaeqrAjLCmq6Nf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
