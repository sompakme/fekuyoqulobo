Every couple, whether they are celebrities or regular folks like you and me, has to go through their own set of ups and downs. So why is it that when we see gossip about new Hollywood couples in the tabloid, we automatically assume they might break up in the near future? Does that have anything to do with the fact that we have witnessed countless celebrity break ups, and are somehow sure that the relationship will end in some time?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the answers may seem believable and quite frankly, true to a certain level, celebrity relationships <i>are</i> more likely to end up in a breakup.&nbsp;If you don't believe me, think about the celebrity breakups stats for a second. In United States, as more and more couples bind themselves in holy matrimony, the divorce rates are rising as well; close to 50%. However, when we talk about celebrity marriages, that number rises at an astounding 70 to 80%; quite a huge difference when you think about it. Nearly everyday, we read and watch news on a new celebrity&nbsp;relationship and/or breakup. Now, I'm not saying that all those paparazzi news are accurate or faulty. However, they do seem to bring forth the uncertain personal lives of the celebrities that society too often follows.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-on-brad-pitt>26. Jennifer Aniston on Brad Pitt</h2><p>via: zeenews.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's been more than a decade since the breakup of Jennifer Aniston's marriage to Brad Pitt. Though both actors eventually moved on to relationships with other people, the public remains fixated on figuring out what went wrong for the one-time "it couple." Although observers are often willing to place the majority of the blame on interference by Angelina Jolie, it turns out there are multiple reasons as to why Aniston and Pitt called it quits.</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>You may be surprised to know there was trouble in paradise before anyone ever heard of Mr. & Mrs. Smith.&nbsp;As much as we'd like to think Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston would still be together had it not been for Angelina Jolie, statements by Pitt indicate he was probably already looking for an out before he found it in his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star.</strong></p><p>In Pitt's own words, he "got burnt out and felt that he was wasting his opportunity." We can only assume he meant he was "wasting his life" in an unhappy marriage instead of being honest about his own feelings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By contrast, Jennifer Aniston seemed ready to work on their decaying marriage. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she said: "Those moments where it looks like 'Uh-oh, this isn't working!' — those are the most important, transformative moments," said Aniston. "That's not Brad's view of it. We believe in different things, I guess. There are many stages of grief. It's sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way—cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I'm a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren't in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it."</p><h2 id=25-demi-moore-on-ashton-kutcher>25.&nbsp;Demi Moore on Ashton Kutcher</h2><p>www.vanityfair.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They tried to bounce back, but Demi Moore&nbsp; couldn't get past the reports of infidelity. "It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton," Moore said in statement from her publicist to ABCNews. "As a woman, a mother and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life. This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation." Right after his divorce from Demi Moore in 2013, Ashton Kutcher took off for the mountains. All he had with him was some water, tea, a pen, and a notepad.</p><p>"I started hallucinating on like day two, which was fantastic," Kutcher told Dax Shepard on an episode of Shepard's podcast, Armchair Expert. "I was doing tai chi with my own energy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong class=punchline-small>Demi Moore has said, "I used to think that what scared me was the idea of being abandoned until someone said to me, 'Only children can be abandoned. Adults can't be abandoned because we have a choice. Children don't have a choice.' So I started to rethink. 'OK, it's not that. What's the underlying thread that really scares me?' I think what scares me is not having the courage to reach my full potential."</strong></p><h2 id=24-madonna-on-guy-ritchie>24.&nbsp;Madonna on Guy Ritchie</h2><p>http://www.dailymail.co.uk</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Madonna has revealed that her marriage to Guy Ritchie collapsed because the romance died, leaving her wondering if true love even existed.&nbsp;The singer said that at the start things were ‘flawless’ but as the years rolled on she began to notice ‘cracks in the veneer’.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>She began to have doubts and realised that marriage ‘wasn’t what I thought it was going to be’.&nbsp;&nbsp;And come the end of their relationship, all she could think about was the brutally blunt question: ‘How much am I willing to sacrifice?’&nbsp;&nbsp;Madonna and Ritchie finally split up in 2008 after eight years of marriage.&nbsp;Madonna’s comments are a rare insight into her marriage, but Ritchie has been far more vocal about their relationship in the past.&nbsp;He has said that whilst he does not regret his time with her, the drama was too much and that their life became a ‘soap opera’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Madonna has said,&nbsp;"What can you say? It was a challenging year. I think work saved me, and I'm very grateful that I had work to do. I may have thrown myself off a building. Life is an adjustment. It's different. My sons aren't with me right now, they're with their father, and I'm not very comfortable with the idea of my children not living together. There are pros and cons, but I feel good now."</p><h2 id=23-jennifer-love-hewitt-on-jamie-kennedy>23.&nbsp;Jennifer Love Hewitt on Jamie Kennedy</h2><p>http://www.purepeople.com</p><p>After a year-long romance, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jamie Kennedy have broken up, a rep has confirmed exclusively to PEOPLE. No further details were available. Though some in the blogosphere called them an unlikely couple, Kennedy and Hewitt regularly gushed&nbsp;about each other. When Kennedy first confirmed the romance in March 2009, he told Ryan Seacrest during a radio interview, “I’m in love!” Describing his co-star on Ghost Whisperer, Kennedy said: “It’s like, ‘Wow, you are hot. You can sing, you can dance, you’re like, so smart and, wow, you can cook pasta fagioli, too.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong class=punchline-small>Hewitt called her beau “hilarious,” but praised him as more than just a funnyman. “There are people in your life who are just supportive and who just look at you and they see who you are,” Hewitt told Ellen DeGeneres last year. “And [Jamie] really saw who I was as a person more than anybody had ever done in my whole life. I think that’s for me when I sort of went, ‘Oh, wow.’ “</strong></p><p>Hewitt has said,&nbsp;"It's what life handed me, and I'm OK with it. I know wholeheartedly that I'm a really good partner. I think I'm a really good girlfriend, and I think that I could be a really good wife. I know that I love being able to give my love out to someone. I know there is somebody great out there for me."</p><h2 id=22-kim-kardashian-on-kris-humphries>22.&nbsp;Kim Kardashian on Kris Humphries</h2><p>eonline.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim Kardashian has spoken about her relationship with Kris Humphries.&nbsp;"I felt like I was on a fast roller coaster and couldn't get off when now I know I probably should have. I got caught up with the hoopla and the filming of the TV show that when I probably should have ended my relationship, I didn't know how to and didn't want to disappoint a lot of people. I'm being honest here and I hope you respect my courage because this isn't easy to go through. But I do know that I have to follow my heart. I never had the intention of hurting anybody and I accept full responsibility for my actions and decisions, and for taking everyone on this journey with me. It just didn't turn out to be the fairy tale I had so badly hoped for."</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Kim Kardashian has revealed she knew her marriage to Kris Humphries would end while on their honeymoon. Appearing on Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live on Sunday night, she confessed that she had a 'freak out' when she turned 30, which spurred her on to 'get her life together' and tie the knot with Kris.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the reality star went on to admit that the decision may have been too rushed as she realised on their honeymoon, just days after the wedding, that the NBA player was not her Mr Right.</p><h2 id=vanessa-paradis-and-johnny-depp>21. Vanessa Paradis and Johnny Depp</h2><p>www.mirror.co.uk</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Johnny Depp is breaking his silence about the end of his 14-year relationship with Vanessa Paradis. The never-wed couple (parents to Lily-Rose and Jack) announced their breakup in June 2012, but the notoriously tight-lipped Lone Ranger actor had kept quiet about their split — until now.</strong></p><p>"The last couple years have been a bit bumpy," Depp tells the magazine. "At times, certainly unpleasant, but that's the nature of breakups, I guess, especially when there are kiddies involved. Relationships are very difficult. Especially in the racket that I'm in because you're constantly away or they're away and so it's hard. It wasn't easy on her. It wasn't easy on me. It wasn't easy on the kids. So, yeah. The trajectory of that relationship — you play it out until it goes, one thing leads to another. So for whatever reason that ­ceases, it doesn't stop the fact that you care for that person, and they're the mother of your kids, and you'll always know each other, and you're always gonna be in each other's lives because of those kids. You might as well make the best of it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Vanessa Paradis has said,&nbsp;"Love is the strongest and most fragile thing we have in life.

Don't push it."</p><h2 id=20-nicole-kidman-on-tom-cruise>20.&nbsp;Nicole Kidman on Tom Cruise</h2><p>www.vanityfair.com</p><p>Before Nicole Kidman found love with husband Keith Urban, the actress spent the entire '90s married to Tom Cruise. The couple first met in 1989 during Nicole's audition for Days of Thunder, and they married shortly after on Dec. 24, 1990. During their relationship, Nicole and Tom starred together in films like Far and Away and Eyes Wide Shut, made several glamorous appearances together, and adopted two children, Connor and Isabella.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong class=punchline-small>In February 2001, however, Tom abruptly filed for divorce, citing "irreconcilable differences" and requesting joint custody of their kids. The reason for their split is still a little hazy, although there have long been rumors that Tom's faith as a Scientologist played a part. The two also rarely spoke about what went wrong in the years following their split, but they (mostly Nicole) have revealed small details about their marriage in recent years.</strong></p><p>Kidman has reminisced,&nbsp;"I'm not sure what the future holds but I do know that I'm going to be positive and not wake up feeling desperate. As my dad said 'Nic, it is what it is, it's not what it should have been, not what it could have been, it is what it is'."</p><h2 id=19-uma-thurman-on-ethan-hawke>19.&nbsp;Uma Thurman on Ethan Hawke</h2><p>www.inquisitr.com</p><p><strong class=punchline-small>Uma Thurman spoke publicly about the breakup, telling Oprah Winfrey on the talk host’s program that – although “I’ve been so cool for so long” – the split was “excruciating” and her self-esteem was “pretty mangled.”</strong></p><p>Thurman and Hawke married in 1998, after meeting on the set of the sci-fi drama Gattaca, and have two children: daughter Maya and son Levon. The couple remained together for five years and were estranged for two. (Thurman was previously married to actor Gary Oldman from 1990-92.)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“You can move on, and you can be lucky and you can seize the moment and you can take one step after another,” said a misty-eyed Thurman about coping with the break. But, she confided, “You bear two children with somebody – that’s not a small thing – and then you can hardly talk to them. When I was first going through my separation, someone said to me, 'It will take you half as long as you were in the relationship before you'll feel better.' And I wanted to knock them out cold across the table. Because, of course, I was in agony. And the last thing I wanted to think was that I was going to stay that way for a long time. But interestingly enough, it is over four years later - we were together eight years - and I finally feel like, cool. I feel better."</p><h2 id=18-kate-moss-on-johnny-depp>18.&nbsp;Kate Moss on Johnny Depp</h2><p>youtube.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johnny Depp‘s romantic history is complex and lengthy.

He was 31, Moss was 20. “I knew from the first moment we talked that we were going to be together,” the model has said. The high-profile couple jet-setted around the globe, depending on where they were working – Moss didn’t have a permanent home at the time, and Depp, who had just invested in the Viper Room in L.A., frequented Hollywood hot spots the Chateau Marmont and the Hollywood Roosevelt. They were never shy about showing their affection for one another in public.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moss has said,&nbsp;"There's nobody that's ever really been able to take care of me.

And my relationship with Affleck self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <i>Gone Girl </i>actor has also been vocal about his split from Lopez. In June 2006, Affleck claimed that his career took a turn for the worse directly following the high profile breakup. “If you went by what people said … I wasn’t cool and I wasn’t talented and I was, like, the lowest run of cool and talented that you could possibly be in the public consciousness at that time,” the <i>Argo </i>director told Bill Simmons at the time. “I had broken up with Jennifer Lopez and I had, like, three or four movies in a row that had bombed.”</p><h2 id=16-reese-witherspoon-on-ryan-phillippe>16.&nbsp;Reese Witherspoon on Ryan Phillippe</h2><p>wmagazine.com</p><p>In the late '90s, no celebrity couple held a candle to the romance between Hollywood A-listers Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Philippe.

In a 2015 appearance on Larry King Now, Phillippe credited their age as a major factor in their divorce. "I think more of the problem was age. When we got together we were so young," Phillippe explained to the talk show host. "I think it can create issues with two people in this industry because there's so much noise that goes along with it."</strong></p><p>Witherspoon has stated,&nbsp;"Divorce is very humiliating and very isolating... But, by the way, if it's not painful, maybe it wasn't the right decision to marry to begin with. Those are the appropriate emotions. When people get in your face and say, 'This will pass,' you think, Are they crazy? I'm never gonna feel any better than I feel right this minute. And nothing's ever gonna make sense again.

Not easy, at least according to Billy Bob Thornton, the actor and Oscar-winning screenwriter who was married to Jolie from 2000 to 2003. Though the difficulty was no fault of Jolie’s, Thornton is quick to clarify, as much as it was his constant feeling of insecurity related to her many humanitarian accomplishments and aspirations. He explained&nbsp;that he was more comfortable watching sports at home while she was out and about, meeting with politicians, other do-gooders, and adoption agencies.</strong></p><p>And Jolie never made him feel bad about his more modest aspirations. The bigger problem, Thornton explains, was that “I’m real uncomfortable around rich and important people.” And he had no desire to change his ways—“I like how I am.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thornton said,&nbsp;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
