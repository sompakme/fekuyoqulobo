You know, I wanted to know … that they were going to stick with me and support me,” Costner said.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Yellowstone</a> star posed on the French festival’s red carpet alongside daughters Annie, 40, and Lily, 37, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Cindy Silva</strong>, as well as his youngest children, Cayden, 17, Hayes, 15, and Grace, 13, whom he shares with ex-wife <strong>Christine Baumgartner</strong>.</p><p>Costner detailed how the family vacation didn’t go precisely to plan.</p><p>“The minute we got there, my two sons went fishing. My three daughters ended up on a boat, and said they’d see me around three or four o’clock … and then I get a call and they were drinking drinks at this point so they cruised in about eight o’clock at night,” Costner said. “I said, ‘We came to France to be as a family’, they go, ‘It’s working great dad, what do we do next?’. I said, ‘I don’t know, we need a tour director to figure that out’.”</p><p>The actor, who cast his son Hayes in Horizon, which is released in cinemas on June 28, also spoke of the 10-minute <a href=# rel=noopener>standing ovation</a> he received when the film premiered on the Sunday.</p><p>“I really didn’t have a sense of what was going to happen. They [the audience] were very still for most of it,” Costner told <strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong>, 56, before sharing further detail into the touching moment. “I actually started walking my life backwards for a second. I kind of went back to the beginning, wondering how I ended up at a place like that. We all have these dreams of where we want to be and I had my own and I’ve taken some really big bites out of life and life has taken some really big ones out of me. But I kind of just keep going and … they started the clap and it didn’t stop.”</p><p>Although Costner was seen with tears in his eyes as the crowd applauded his first directorial turn in more than ten years, the actor maintained he was not crying.</p><p>“I didn’t f—king cry. My eyes were full,” he said with a smile. “But I was moved by what happened in France. I was moved by the biggest film festival in the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The glowing response comes after a rocky year for the actor, who parted ways with Baumgartner, 50, after she <a href=# rel=noopener>filed for divorce</a> to end 19 years of marriage in May 2023.</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in May 2023 that Baumgartner had cited irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Their split got off to a messy start, igniting a four-month legal battle before the pair reached a settlement in September 2023.
