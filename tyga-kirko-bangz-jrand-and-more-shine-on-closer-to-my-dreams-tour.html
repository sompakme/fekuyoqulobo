The arena went dark for a brief moment, with only a single red light illuminating the stage. Tyga appeared on the stage in a beam of yellow light, sending the audience into a frenzy.</p><p>The Last Kings captain didn’t waste any time, segueing into tracks from “Well Done 3” as well as “#BitchImTheShit,” before streamlining into his top-charting singles, “Faded” sans Lil Wayne and “Rack City.” Romancing his fans, he brought out Kirko Bangz for a performance of “Girls and Guitars,” before inviting a handful of women on stage for the finale performance of the increasingly popular, “Do My Dance.”</p><p>In the years The Closer to My Dreams Tour has been in existence, it has yet to stray from its reputation as a platform for the industry’s hottest artists to strut their stuff before skyrocketing to their musical destiny. While Tyga is a veteran of the all-popular tour, as history dictates, last night’s performance was truly for the fans.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>Photo Credit: Porterhouse LA</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6nGqK2MpKCro59ir6K6xrNko6qRo7Furc2dZKanopp6tLTIp5xmm5ykwKa%2BjKawZpyimq6uv4ytpq6qXWZ%2BcoGQcmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
