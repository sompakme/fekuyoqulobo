However, the show also ran into some controversy behind the scenes in terms of contestants breaking the rules and as we're going to reveal later, other lawsuits.</p><p>The most memorable moment of a contestant breaking the rules goes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Charles Ingram who was caught cheating</a>. Host Chris Tarrant asks, "A number one followed by one hundred zeros is known by what name?"</p><p>After taking a long break, Ingram answers A, Goggol. The answer was correct and caused him to win the grand prize. However, it was later deemed that the contestant got extra help from his wife.</p><p>LAD Bible writes, "It later emerged that his wife Diana and accomplice Tecwen Whittock used cheating tactics which included coughing at answers throughout the show. The trio were eventually found guilty of conspiring to cheat to win the £1m ($1.25m) jackpot. Instead of winning £1million, the Ingrams' cheating cost them a massive £115,000."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Judge Judy's Guilty Party Refused To Leave The Courtroom After The Cameras Stopped Filming</a></span></p><p>Fans were also quick to notice that Ingram looked quite different answering questions compared to the former winners. It was not a good look in the end for the contestant, but the same unfortunately held true for Ed Mitchell after he made an honest mistake.</p><h2 id=ed-mitchell-made-a-mess-of-his-double-dip-lifeline-and-broke-the-rules>Ed Mitchell Made A Mess Of His Double Dip Lifeline And Broke The Rules</h2><p>Unlike Ingram, poor Ed Mitchell made an honest mistake during his time on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. His mistake cost him thousands, Mitchell was going for $25,000, and ends up losing $15,000 instead. This all stems from Mitchell using the Double Dip lifeline. This gives a contestant a shot at two answers.</p><p>After Mitchell gets the first one incorrect, he must answer again in the allotted time to his disposal. However, just as the clock is expiring, Mitchell chooses to walk away with money. Though he doesn't realize this is against the rules... Not only did Mitchell make a mistake, but he wasn't able to give a second answer either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The official lifeline rule state, "Once a Contestant elects to use the Double Dip lifeline the Contestant must give a Final Answer to the question. When the Contestant states he/she wants to use Double Dip the game clock stops and the Contestant must immediately state his/her first answer. If the first answer is incorrect, the Host states how much time remains on the game clock and the game clock resumes. The Contestant must select another answer. If a Contestant's second answer is incorrect or if he/she fails to select a second answer before time expires on the game clock, the Contestant is eliminated."</p><p>The moment can be seen below thanks to the Mech channel on YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Boy George Walked Out Of A Blind Audition On The Voice And It Caused Everyone To Turn On Him</a></span></p><p>A tough ending for Ed who ends up walking away with $1,000 instead of the $16K he had in the bank at that point.</p><h2 id=who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-took-home-millions-in-court-against-disney>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire Took Home Millions In Court Against Disney</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/regis-philbin.jpeg><p>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire has been involved with other controversies. This one in particular took place over profits alongside Disney. It was said that Disney cheated the show out of massive profits, estimated to be in the range of 50%. By the end of it, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the show walked away with $319 million from Disney.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Evening Standard writes, "Celador claimed Disney’s ABC network had cheated them out of the 50 percent share of profits it was entitled to from the American version of the quiz show, the Guardian reported. Disney appealed the ruling but lost, and in 2012, the US conglomerate was ordered to pay the damages plus interest - with the new total hitting a whopping US$319 million (£198m at the time)."</p><p>The report continues, "The jury had ruled Disney had breached its license agreement with Celador, which was forged in 1998."</p><p>Disney issued a statement claiming to be disappointed in the decision given that a mutual understanding was apparently made between the two sides.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYZq%2BYpHq4rc2tqmasn2KvpnnAZqSipJyevK%2BtyKucZpufo8Gmv9Oapa1lpKe2prCMsJilo5mjtG671K1kqJ5dqbWmedKhprBlkqrBbq7RqKKeZaSdsm6%2B1KWcrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
