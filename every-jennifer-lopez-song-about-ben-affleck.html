Affleck and Lopez first <a href=#>connected on the set</a> of the film Gigi where they played gangsters who fell in love. After Lopez <a href=#>split from then-husband</a> <strong>Cris Judd</strong> in June 2002, she and Affleck went public with their romance. Lopez and the <a href=#>Oscar winner</a> were engaged five months later.</p><p>In addition to their relationship milestones in that first year, Lopez released her album This Is Me … Then, which she dedicated to Affleck at the time. The album featured some of Lopez’s biggest songs, including “Jenny from the Block,” “All I Have,” “Baby I Love U,” “I’m Glad” and more.</p><p>Nearly two decades after the album’s release, Lopez reflected on how meaningful the record was to her.</p><p>“When I listened to that [album] on many, many different levels, those songs are more relevant today than they even were then,” she said in a July 2021 interview with Apple Music. “It was a real pure moment in time. And that music, when it’s important, it never goes away … love, it just doesn’t go away. It’s just there.”</p><p>Despite being happy and in love at first, the pair ultimately called off their wedding in 2004. Following their split, Lopez went on to wed <a href=#><strong>Marc Anthony</strong></a>. Affleck, for his part, moved on with <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>. Both relationships ended in divorce.</p><p>Seven years after their breakup, Lopez and Affleck <a href=#>rekindled their romance</a>. In April 2022, Affleck proposed for a second time. Three months later, the pair secretly <a href=#>tied the knot in Las Vegas</a> and had <a href=#>a second ceremony</a> for friends and family at Affleck’s Georgia home.</p><p>Lopez released the song “Midnight Trip to Vegas” in July 2023 to commemorate the couple’s<a href=#> first wedding anniversary</a>. She shared the lyrics of the new song in a newsletter ahead of the official release of her album This Is Me … Now later in 2023.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see which of Lopez’s songs were inspired by Affleck:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-Complete-Guide-to-Every-Song-Jennifer-Lopez-Has-Written-About-Ben-Affleck-353.jpg><h3>‘I’m Glad’</h3><p><strong>Album:</strong> This Is Me … Then</p><p><strong>Standout Lyric:</strong> “I’m glad when I’m making love to you / I’m glad for the way you make me feel / I love it ’cause you seem to blow my mind / Every time I’m glad (I’m glad) when you walk (I’m glad), you hold my hand (I’m glad) / I’m happy that you know how to be a man / I’m glad (I’m glad) that you came into my life (I’m glad) / I’m so glad.”</p><h3>‘Baby I Love U’</h3><p><strong>Album:</strong> This Is Me … Then</p><p><strong>Standout Lyric:</strong> “What I wanna know is / Are you willing to try / There’s gotta be more meaning to this / Than what meets the eye / Baby I love you (baby, I need you) / Baby I need you (gotta have you, baby).”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/A-Complete-Guide-to-Every-Song-Jennifer-Lopez-Has-Written-About-Ben-Affleck-355.jpg><h3>‘Dear Ben’</h3><p><strong>Album:</strong> This Is Me … Then</p><p><strong>Standout Lyric:</strong> “I think God made you for me / A mix of passionate fidelities / Baby, you’re so complete / I write this song to let you know / That you will always be to me / My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>‘Midnight Trip to Vegas’</h3><p><strong>Album:</strong> This Is Me … Then</p><p><strong>Standout Lyric:</strong> “Event of the ages / Caught in the matrix / Then you whispered in my ear / Said let’s get out of here / We can disappear tonight,” she sings in the opening verse before launching into the chorus. “What about a midnight trip to Vegas / Just me and you baby / Throw the kids in the back of the pink Cadillac.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaerpWnxm62xKelop6Vp3qtu8%2BesWarn6O0bq3BqKytZZKau26txZ%2BjnpubZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
