In 1976, Crocco left the company to try his luck in the business. He formed MDM Geneve and he released the first watch under this brand in 1980. The watch’s porthole-like face inspired him to call it the “Hublot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The watch was an immediate hit. Buyers were attracted to Hublot’s modern style and innovative strap. Hublot had set a precedent by making use of the first natural rubber straps ever seen on a watch. It took three years to develop before it was decided that the strap was superior because of its ability to remain soft and supple even after extended use and exposure to the elements. It has since become a requirement for practically every watch brand.</p><p>Hublot has since been bought by the French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy – Louis Vuitton S.A.&nbsp; It has become highly sought after that Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive officer of Formula One, was once mugged by a group of men for his Hublot watch. Endorsers include the entire Mancheter United football team, Usain Bolt, Diego Maradona and the surviving members of the family of Ayrton Senna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Counterfeit Hublots have also appeared in the market, forcing Hublot to devise a system to authenticate their watches on its servers. It is called the WISeKey and it started operations in August 2009.</p><p>Hublot is known for making expensive watches. Here is a list of the top 10 most expensive Hublot watches.</p><h2 id=1-the-hublot-5-million---5-million><b>1. The Hublot $5 million - $5 million</b></h2><p>This is the most expensive watch in the world and the president of the company has already gone on record to say that it will be difficult to top this because of the limited nature and supply of the surface of the watch. It is encrusted with 1,200 diamonds weighing 140 carats in all. These include six stones that each weigh at least three carats. The company assigned 17 people to the project and it took them 14 months to finish creating the watch. American superstar Beyonce Knowles has already purchased one for her husband Jay-Z.</p><h2 id=2-hublot-million-dollar-black-caviar-bang---1-million><b>2. Hublot Million Dollar Black Caviar Bang - $1 million</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Million Dollar Black Caviar Bang won the Grand Prix de Geneve Jewellery Watch prize in 2009. The watch is made of white gold that weighs 18 carats. It does not have any numbers on its face and it has an adjustable leather strap.

The “normal” will tell the time accurately. The third speeds up time by interpreting each actual quarter hour as one hour on the watch. The practical application is actually limited but the watch is really a showcase of the complicated movement that Hublot is capable of creating. It is made of titanium and the strap, while it retains the black rubber material, sports a futuristic look. Power reserve can last up to four hours.
