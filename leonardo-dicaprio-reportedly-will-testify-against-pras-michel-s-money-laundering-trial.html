In addition, Low's rep issued an emailed statement, saying the Justice Department was continuing its "inappropriate efforts" to seize assets and that its recent activity marked a "further example of global overreach in pursuit of a deeply flawed case," the outlet said.</p><p>In 2018, federal prosecutors charged Low for conspiracy to commit money laundering, bribery and circumvention of accounting controls for allegedly masterminding the embezzlement of $4.5 billion from 1MBD.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The same year, Red Granite reached an agreement with prosecutors to pay $60 million to the U.S. government in order to resolve allegations that it profited from the corruption scandal, <a href=#><i>Variety</i></a> reported, adding that under the deal, it did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p><p>Also in 2018, DiCaprio gave secret testimony to a Washington, D.C. grand jury to testify as part of the Justice Department's investigation into the scandal, people familiar with the case told the <a href=#><i>Washington Post</i></a>, adding the actor was not a target of the probe.</p><p>On Oct. 9, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a proposed witness list in connection with the case. DiCaprio, who had ties to Low, is the 25th person on it. E! News has reached out to DiCaprio's rep and has not heard back. Michel's attorney declined to comment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Michel is set to stand trial from November 4 in Washington, DC, accused of illegally lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of the Chinese government and illegally giving contributions to the Obama administration before it.</p><p>Earlier this year, speculation circled that Fugees cancelled their 25th anniversary tour celebrating second album ‘The Score’ not due to COVID concerns, as originally stated, but Michel’s ongoing legal issues.</p><p>In November, <a href=#>Fugees</a> member Pras Michel will officially stand trial for his part in the 1 Malaysian Development Berhad embezzlement scheme. With the involvement of several high-profile figures across multiple countries and occupations, the 1MDB had its money systematically stolen to fund several different projects, all under the supervision of Malaysian businessman Jho Low, according to <a href=#><i>Far Out Magazine.</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pras partially used his embezzled money to contribute financially to the 2012 re-election campaign of former president Barack Obama. Another prominent beneficiary of the scheme was Red Granite Pictures, the American film production company that helped fund Martin Scorsese’s 2013 film <i>The Wolf of Wall Street</i>.</p><p>With that connection in place, lead actor and <i>Wolf of Wall Street </i>co-producer Leonardo DiCaprio has been named as one of the witnesses set to testify against Michel at his upcoming trial. DiCaprio had previously cooperated with the federal investigation and testified during the initial trial investigations back in 2019.</p><p>DiCaprio might be the most high-profile witness testifying at the trial, but he’s certainly not the only one. Among the 72 other called witnesses are former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, former deputy national security advisor Matt Pottinger, and former national security advisor H.R. McMaster. Also set to testify in former RNC Finance Chairman Elliott Broidy, who was famously pardoned by former president Donald Trump in 2021.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As <a href=#><i>Mxdwn </i></a>reported, The case claims that Pras allegedly conspired against the American government through fraud, that he made illegal foreign campaign contributions, that he illegally concealed material facts, and that he made a false entry in a record relating to conspiracy. Pras is accused of allegedly funneling money for Jho Low, a Malaysian citizen, who is well known in Hollywood for holding high profile parties. Jho Low’s location is currently unknown by law enforcement, while the businessman remains internationally wanted after the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, involving the embezzlement of billions of state-investment funds.</p><p>Among the witnesses set to appear at the upcoming trial will be the famed actor Leonardo DiCaprio, whose movie <i>The Wolf of Wall Street </i>may have been partially financed by Jho Low.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The prosecution has argued that Jho Low allegedly sent the Fugees rapper over $100 million in order to illegally influence the 2012 presidential election. In 2012, the funds were allegedly intended to support the re-election of Barack Obama. Later, the funds were allegedly intended to influence the administration of Donald Trump to end the Department of Justice’s investigation into Jho Low’s activities. The prosecution also alleges that Pras attempted to influence Donald Trump’s administration to have a Chinese dissident to be sent back to China; with the rapper allegedly working on behalf of the Chinese government.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b> Candance Owens Allegedly Leaked Kim Kardashian's Old Recording Audio Calling Whitney Houston An "Old Hag"</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>E!
