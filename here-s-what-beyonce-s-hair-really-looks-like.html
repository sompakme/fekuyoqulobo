Fans become inquisitive about their idols' life. They become undercover detectives like Sherlock Holmes, only to find out the truth about them! Nonetheless, as far as BeyHives go, the one thing which they couldn't find out until recently was what&nbsp;Beyoncé's hair really looks like!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reese Witherspoon Wants Everyone To Know Beyoncé Is Her Bestie</a></span></p><p>From an angled bob to a pompadour, Queen B styled differently on many occasions and the last thing everyone knew was that the Crazy in Love singer had a pixie cut in 2013, but it's no surprise that her hair would already grow out to be one of the most gorgeous, thick and capacious hair anyone has ever seen. She looks so perfect and stunning that she could even pull off a half-up ponytail and make all the ladies jealous!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, the 38-year-old singer's longtime best friend and hairstylist <a href=#>Neal Farinah</a> was reported to have confirmed that&nbsp;Beyoncé was wearing her naturally curly hair. There was an ongoing debate for a long time before Neal himself tackled the dispute in a video on his page.</p><p>"Sometimes women make choices, and Black women are not the only ones who wear wigs and weaves and pieces--remember that," Neal said. "And underneath wigs and weaves, Black women have some of the most beautiful, curly hair. It's a choice women make--and that's the choice a Black woman makes, to wear wigs or weaves if she wants to. Ain't nothing wrong with it. So, the myth about Black women not having hair? Y'all think again, 'cause they have some of the most beautiful, textured hair."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Things Beyoncé Has Revealed About Her Pregnancies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, <a href=#>Tina Knowles</a>,&nbsp;Beyoncé's mother, businesswoman, fashion designer a hairdresser and a salon owner disclosed her daughter's real hair on a video which she had uploaded on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> page.</p><p>In that video, Tina was seen running a comb through Beyoncé's hair while saying, "Au Naturale darling." and&nbsp;Beyoncé in return responded with "Mama that's really annoying...I mean very annoying."</p><p>Tina had also surprised the fans by uploading a photo of&nbsp;Beyoncé's long honey blonde hair with a rather amusing and cute caption,&nbsp;"INCHES!!!!

NATURAL CURLY HAIR OTRII ROME."</p><p>In an interview with <a href=#>ELLE</a>, Neal Farinah was asked, "What are some of your favorite looks you've done for Beyoncé over the years?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Oh my God. There's so many favorites," He replied enthusiastically. "I would not lie. Sometimes I look back and say, 'My God, I can't believe I created so many iconic hairstyles.' During the Formation tour, that magical braid had its own life. It's just the moment. You look on the internet...and it broke the internet! So I love it. I just love every moment."</p><p>Well, Neal isn't wrong. We too are in love with&nbsp;Beyoncé's hair and no matter if she wears wigs or weaves or leaves her hair the way&nbsp;it is, she will always be this amazing and the most breathtaking Black woman out there who will undoubtedly run the world with her fabulousness.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé, Brad Pitt And 13 Other Celebs Who Crashed Normal People's Weddings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJudqaS7pLHSZp%2BaoaJiv6aty6WwZqSfpLi0ecuiop5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
