This is the case for many fans out there that go hard for their favorite celebrity, whether it’s leading the Rihanna Navy or being the head of the Beyhive. But thanks to social media and meet-and-greets around the nation, and some fans simply running into celebrities on the street, we know that some stars just aren’t as nice as they appear to be at times. This brings about the question of whether some of these celebrities will stand as hard for their fans as the fans do for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Granted, not everyone can put on a happy face every time they meet a fan. I mean, we all know they’re human too, and might just be having a bad day. But there is another group of celebrities who are known for just simply being mean to their fans and nearly going as far as not really caring if their fans support them or not. Sometimes these celebrities have been jaded and had enough run-ins with rude fans that they just group all of them together, even the nice ones, and cut them off from any emotional attachment. Other times, they just simply don’t care enough. Either way, there are more than enough moments to go around that let us know some celebrities are just super rude to their fans.</p><h2 id=justin-bieber>15. Justin Bieber</h2><p>We all remember <a href=#>Justin Bieber</a> singing&nbsp;“Baby, Baby, Baby, oohhhhh” in his early days, and he grew up right before our eyes. It’s no secret this caused lots of pressure for the somewhat of a bad boy. He has had plenty of moments toward his fans, also known as the Beliebers, that were not only rude but just downright disrespectful. Yet somehow, he has managed to stay on top of the charts, so he must not be rude enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From the time he tried to punch out a photographer to when he spit at his fans and even mooned some of them, Justin has shown time and time again that he might just be a complete jerk. And that’s not even including the time he was caught continuously saying the “N” word on video and laughing with his friends. He also has shut down official meet-and-greets with fans after confessing he felt like a “zoo animal.” Now, this part is pretty understandable. But there’s no excuse to dismiss fans who love him.</p><h2 id=jason-segel>14. Jason Segel</h2><p>He might have played the loveable Marshall on How I Met Your Mother, but <a href=#>Jason Segel </a>is another star known for being mean to his fans. I have to admit I was disappointed about this one, but this is a perfect lesson of why it’s not a good idea to think that actors are anything like the characters they play on television or in movies. Other fans were also said to be “shocked” when Segel was rude to them at a premiere of&nbsp;Sex Tape,&nbsp;that also starred <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>. Interestingly enough, the premiere was said to be an event where fans could meet the actors. But both of the stars were said to be “awful,” according to Radar Online. Segel is said to have “literally slammed the car door right in the fan’s face” after the “20-something” person asked for a photo with him. On top of that, Segel sparked up controversy a few years before when he mocked How I Met Your Mother in an interview with GQ.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz>13. Cameron Diaz</h2><p>I couldn’t go too much further without discussing Segel’s Sex Tape co-star Diaz as they were both said to be mean to their fans who waited for hours to meet them at the premiere. As for Diaz, one fan said she “lectured” them and “refused” to take photos. She was heard saying, “If I did it for you I’d have to do it for everyone” just before she “stormed off.” What makes matters worse is that they both took off just before the play button was pressed on the movie. One source said, “Cameron was as unfriendly as can be and it was really disappointing.” They said it’s not even like it was a large mob of fans who were trying to get a photo but rather only four or five. Interestingly enough, Diaz went to greater lengths to defend her BFF <a href=#>Drew Barrymore</a>. She abruptly ended an interview with the Kyle and Jackie O&nbsp;radio show after Kyle brought up Barrymore’s allege drug abuse. At least she’s a good friend…right?</p><h2 id=ariana-grande>12. Ariana Grande</h2><p>This former teeny-bopper has also been said to rub fans the wrong way on more than one occasion. The sad part is she started off as such a sweet girl – pretty much in the same category as Bieber. But what happened? Somehow the stresses of life possibly got to her because now she is said to be a rude diva, even to her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One fan who won a contest via MTV tweeted that she was “disappointed” her “idol” <a href=#>Ariana</a> would “treat us like this.” The singer said she cried because she was given a photo of her grandfather and didn’t want fans to see her breakdown. Still, months later speculation swirled that Grande was a “diva” and even said she wanted her fans to “die.” Even E! News host <a href=#>Giuliana Rancic</a> said Ariana has a “diva thing going on.” She also caught lots of heat after she was caught dissing the nation, and that time a donut shop got video of her licking a donut and putting it back on display.</p><h2 id=kanye-west>11. Kanye West</h2><p>This one is not a shocker at all.&nbsp;<a href=#>Kanye West</a> has countless moments where&nbsp;he allegedly went&nbsp;after his fans, including the time that one fan was so happy to meet him, and all the rapper could do was point out that the Yeezy shoes he had on were&nbsp;fake. Keep in mind this was all on a video that went viral. I feel like he could have at least whispered it in the fan’s ear or something. But hey, that’s just Kanye sometimes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye left thousands of fans disappointed when he abruptly cancelled shows on his Saint Pablo Tour before ending it altogether. He also filled moments that were supposed to be him performing with him going on a rant and blasting other celebrities like <a href=#>Beyonce</a>. Still, he was said to have been going through a mental breakdown so he definitely gets a pass. And while he is said to be mean to his fans, he has done lots for them in the past as well, like with his pop-up performances.</p><h2 id=amy-schumer>10. Amy Schumer</h2><p>Maybe it’s a stigma that women in the same category as <a href=#>Amy Schumer</a>, <a href=#>Amy Poehler</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Tina Fey</a>, <a href=#>Kristen Wiig</a>, among others, should just always be cheerful and pleasant. Apparently this isn’t the case with Schumer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Remember the time she posted a fan’s photo on her Instagram page after he snapped a photo of her during a trip to Greenville, South Carolina? She also added a caption that shut him down and said that he forced her to take a picture and told her, “no it’s America and we paid for you.” She used him as an example of why she wouldn’t take photos with fans anymore. She also pointed out multiple times that she said “stop” and “no” and that he didn’t listen, which was not a good look for his daughter who was standing nearby. Once the situation died down a bit, she said she would only be taking pictures with “nice people,” if she thinks it’s a “good time.” The fan posted a video that tells quite a different story than Schumer’s recollection of events.</p><h2 id=jared-leto>9. Jared Leto</h2><p>One fan’s bad interaction with the actor after a Thirty Seconds To Mars concert has put <a href=#>Leto</a> in this category of celebrities who are mean to their fans. The fan&nbsp;told Thought Catalog that the band “talked amongst themselves” as they “absentmindedly signed autographs” after the show. But Leto’s reaction stood out from the others. “When I got to Jared Leto, I said, ‘Hey,that was a great show!’ He responded, ‘I signed your s***, now f*** off!’” Yikes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Interestingly enough, he also rubbed his Suicide Squad co-stars the wrong way from the moment he joined the cast. He reportedly sent them terrible gifts, like when <a href=#>Will Smith</a> got actual bullets and even sent <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> a dead rat. But things are said to have gotten worse when they started taping because Leto is said to have stayed in character the entire time, even when the cameras weren’t rolling. I can understand how this could get annoying.</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera>8. Christina Aguilera</h2><p>Yep, she’s on here too, guys. <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a>&nbsp;had a bad moment with fans when it was revealed that she actually despises shopping with them. I’m not sure why this is an issue for her, maybe they’re a distraction, or maybe she just wants a little extra privacy? Either way, tons of fans were upset when she made a gag gift shop close up so she could shop in peace inside. Now, I think this is more diva behavior than mean. But what made matters worse is when she left she didn’t acknowledge the fans who were waiting outside of the store. Aguilera didn’t speak or even look at them. But she managed to laugh as she walked out, making the situation go from a star simply wanting some personal space to laughing at fans that would probably never get the same treatment and might have simply wanted a photo with her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sandra-bullock>7. Sandra Bullock</h2><p><a href=#>Sandra Bullock</a> was taken out of the running for America’s Sweetheart after she blasted a&nbsp;wheelchair bound fan. Interestingly enough, this was just after the nation was starting to fall more in love with her following the success of her tear-jerker The Blind Side. A woman said she was out and about with her husband, who is also a veteran, when they saw the actress filming for The Heat. The couple got closer to her during a break and it just went downhill from there. She is said to have been “so rude” as she “covered her face and yelled.” It’s completely understandable to be in the zone while filming, only to be interrupted by a couple of fans who hope to capture the once in a lifetime moment. But she might have gone too far in this incident. In her defense, she can’t be Miss Congeniality all the time!</p><h2 id=tobey-maguire>6. Tobey Maguire</h2><p>The actor has no problem playing a hero as Spider-Man, but it might be asking too much to get an autograph from him in real life. In fact, his rude behavior when asked for his John Hancock has made history and earned him the title of the Worst Autograph Signer by Autograph Collector magazine. Yeah, that really does exist. Maguire was reportedly, “so wrapped up in his own egotistical web that he has earned the distinction of being the worst signer of the year.” So what earned him this title? Well one fan told Thought Catalogue about their dad, who worked security for Spider-Man, and his experience with the star. “A couple of the guard’s excitement got the best of them and asked Tobey Maguire for some photos and signatures. I don’t know if it was a long hard day in the salt mines but he continued to throw the end all be all of s*** storms… He ended up getting like six guys fired.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna>5. Rihanna</h2><p>One thing I like about <a href=#>RiRi</a>&nbsp;is that she owns her bad attitude. She knows she has it and she doesn’t try to hide it. That doesn’t make it right of course, but at least it’s no surprise she’s on this list. She shut down a fan on Twitter when the 16-year-old attempted to channel her style for a prom dress. She went as far as using the phrase “Dark Thot Rises” and “#prombat” that actually ended up going viral. This was definitely out of line and probably ruined the fan’s entire perspective of Rihanna. In another incident, one fan said her coworker and her children won tickets to meet Rihanna after a concert. But they were disappointed when she refused to even look at them and had one of her background dancers sign her name for her before she motioned for them to leave. They said now the girls won’t even listen to Rihanna’s music.</p><h2 id=will-ferrell>4. Will Ferrell</h2><p>Funny guy <a href=#>Will Ferrell</a> has a rap for being a jerk to his fans. He might be one of the actors who channels his characters when meeting people in real life. Autograph Magazine said that Ferrell, “mocks people, taunts, and embarrasses them when they ask for autographs.” Rumor has it he does this to get over the awkwardness of meeting people in real life as he is said to be shy in person. This could actually be true because on the flip side, Ferrell confessed he is a bit awkward in an interview with Huffington Post. He also didn’t really seem to mind that the now late <a href=#>Joan Rivers</a> called him a jerk after meeting him at a Golden Globes event. He said he went to speak to Rivers and she said, “Excuse me, do you know who you’re interrupting?” His response? “Yes, they’re very big important people.” You have to admit it’s kind of funny.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristin-cavallari>3. Kristin Cavallari</h2><p>After seeing her portrayed as&nbsp;the popular diva on MTV’s Laguna Beach&nbsp;and The Hills, it’s not really a shocker that <a href=#>Kristin Cavallari</a>&nbsp;is said to act mean toward her fans. One in particular said she approached Kristen, told her how much she loved her, and asked for an autograph. Cavallari reportedly thanked her by mocking her behind her back. Interestingly enough, Kristin has said that while she played a mean girl on the reality shows, she really isn’t that way in reality. She said in the early days of Laguna Beach she and her co-star Stephen (who went on to star in shows like One Tree Hill) were actually going strong until the producers made him get close to&nbsp;<a href=#>Lauren Conrad</a> AKA LC. While it made for good television to see the love triangle play out, Kristen admitted it impacted her deeply. Maybe the mean girl persona was her putting up her guard? We can only assume</p><h2 id=naomi-campbell>2. Naomi Campbell</h2><p>This supermodel isn’t only known for being mean to her every day fans, but also models who came after her who were her fans as well. <a href=#>Tyra Banks</a> confessed she was “very scared” of <a href=#>Naomi Campbell</a> after the industry tried to pin them against each other when Banks was the new model on the scene. She hasn’t detailed what Naomi did, but said in an interview with the Swedish show&nbsp;Skavlan, “I don’t condone her actions and her response, but I understand where it comes from… She reacted strongly, but I kind of understand where that was coming from inside of her.” Naomi has since apologized for whatever it is she did. But she later ended up getting in legal trouble after she threw her cell phone at her maid (and hit her in the head) about ten years ago. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five days of community service and had to go to anger management. She also had to pay the maid’s hospital bills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=robert-pattinson>1. Robert Pattinson</h2><p>This heartthrob reportedly doesn’t return the love to his fans. He had a not so positive message about his fans during an interview with none other than Interview magazine. “What’s really weird about ‘Twilight’ fans is that they’re not really teenagers,” he said. “Most of them are older. ‘Twilight’ has its own fan culture that existed from day one. And in an intense way that didn’t exist before. Sometimes I ask myself what these masses of people do the whole day. They sit in front of their computers and comment on anything having even remotely to do with ‘Twilight.’” Even if that’s true, without their support he would&nbsp;not be as famous as he is today. I’m certain this interview made tons of fans switch over to Team Jacob thanks to Robert’s audacious and bold comments. Maybe he’s never been to a theater where Twilight was actually playing; if he did he would have seen a ton of teenagers supporting him as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHq4tM5mmKudXamys77Im6OeZaSkerW0xKKpZp6Ro8Bw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
