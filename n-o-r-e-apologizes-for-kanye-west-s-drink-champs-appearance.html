On Monday, N.O.R.E. called into <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Breakfast Club</a>, to address the Floyd commentary, adding that Ye had conditions for his appearance on the pod.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-17-at-7.41.26-AM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I&nbsp;just wanna be honest, I support freedom of speech,” N.O.R.E. said. “I support anybody, you know, not being censored. But I do not support anybody being hurt. I did not realize that the George Floyd statements on my show was so hurtful. And you gotta realize, it was the first five minutes of the show. When he walked in, he told my producer, he said that if he’ll stop filming that he’ll walk out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“So, I didn’t want a Birdman moment. I didn’t want a Birdman moment [like] with y’all like when Birdman walked out. I wanted the man to speak…I actually checked him about the George Floyd comment. I actually checked him about the White Lives Matter [shirt], but it was so [much] later in the episode. I was already inebriated at that time. Maybe people looked over it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I apologize to the George Floyd family,” he added. “I apologize to anybody that was hurt by Kanye West’s comments.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">N.O.R.E. also addressed the issue on Hot 97’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Ebro In The Morning</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I felt I could control the situation,” he explained to Peter Rosenberg, DJ Kast One, and Laura Stylez. “I felt like I can control the interview. And I learned early on that I didn’t. As a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Black man</a>, I feel like I failed. As a human, I feel like I failed. But as a journalist, I succeeded.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1429208123.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# id=auto-tag_drink-champs data-tag=drink-champs>Drink Champs</a> host continued to explain how he did offer pushback that was not featured until later in the interview. Still, N.O.R.E. says he should have checked Ye on the spot. He confessed he was too drunk by the end of the discussion to fully address the Chicago rapper at the moment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I didn’t think he was going to spread <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>this ideology</a>. I didn’t think he was going to go there,” he said. “I thought he was going to have a couple drinks. He smoked blunts with us. I thought it was going to be light-hearted.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He later added, “I learned my lesson.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O8s7GMmqeopJ%2Bcxm63wKewnmWnmsC1ecOroKejXZi1ornPrGRqamNphHF%2BkmtsaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
