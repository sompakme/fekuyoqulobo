The 56-year-old media personality apologized to the Houston rapper during her recent appearance on <a href=#>Club Shay Shay</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Meg, before we go any further, I want to apologize to you personally,” the NFL Hall Of Famer said toward the beginning of their conversation. “I always wanted to sit down and have a conversation with you—I didn’t know if that was going to be possible… I… told a joke and I said it in jest, but I believe the joke would have been just as funny had I left you out of it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He apologized for “any unwanted attention, harm, shame, embarrassment” that he may have caused Meg or her family. The <a href=#>Megan</a> rapper earnestly accepted the apology, even going as far as to place her hands over her heart. The two then toasted some of his Shay By Le Portier cognac and discussed her musical career, JAY-Z, Beyoncé, and much more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In November 2023, Shannon Sharpe received a lot of backlash for his unfiltered comments about Megan Thee Stallion on <a href=#>Nightcap</a>. “I’d have her stretched out like a quarter to three,” he said. “I do it three ways, Ocho: deep, hard, and continuously… I’d have her opening up like saloon doors.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Love Shannon, but this is wildly inappropriate,” one fan wrote on Instagram. “He is employed by ESPN. They don’t play that, he needs to tone it down on these types of comments. It’s not the 90s anymore.” Another user felt that it was poor timing given the sexual assault lawsuits that came out around that time, namely Diddy’s. “In light of all the lawsuits, I just want men to chill for a min,” they wrote. “Like take a step back from the overt/public sex talk and stories and find something safe to chat about.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For what it’s worth, the<a href=#> First Take</a> host did offer an apology soon after his initial comments and the subsequent reactions. “If Meg had a problem with anything that I’ve said, let me take the time to say, I’m sorry. I apologize,” he said. His Nightcap co-host Chad Ochocinco assured him that he was still in good standing with both himself and the fans by saying, “And we love you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i1orrNqKVmq5iWv7GxjJqnqKSfnLa7sdJmpJ6fkaN6tbTEnmSsrJGhuaq7zWaqnrCllrlur86mpJ6mpKh6cn6SbW9yaWFlfnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
