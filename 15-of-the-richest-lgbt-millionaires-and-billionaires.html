These CEOs and entrepreneurs have been relatively open in both their private and public lives about their sexuality, but not every person who identifies as LGBT feels the need to come forward. It is, then, very possible that the&nbsp;Forbes&nbsp;list of billionaires contains more than the official small percentage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joining the LGBT billionaires are the millionaires who dominate this list, at least one of whom has only recently stated publicly that he is a proud gay man. There are many reasons for wanting to share or hide this information with the world. Some believe doing so will help the cause of LGBT rights. Others have never made an attempt to hide their sexuality although still others have purposely kept their sexuality hidden to avoid repercussions from their business colleagues.</p><p>Ranked from least rich to most rich, the following LGBT millionaires and billionaires all agree that their sexual orientation has - of course - no impact on their professional competence. Some financial giants, such as Wall Street executives, have argued being open is the best thing for the prosperity of any business.</p><h2 id=15-trevor-burgess><strong>15.

Trevor Burgess, CEO of C1 Bank based in Florida, has become the first openly gay CEO of a publicly listed bank. The bank successfully completed their IPO (Initial Public Offering) in August, 2014 to the tune of over $44 million dollars. The leaders of Wall Street congratulated and welcomed C1 Bank to their group. They believe that people who are upfront about their sexual preferences are more productive and engaged which&nbsp;"directly impacts the success of their organizations.”</p><p></p><h2 id=14-michael-kors><b>14.
