After being chosen for the World War II drama Band of Brothers (2001), Hardy left London's prestigious Drama Center and went on to play "Twombly" in Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down (2001). He made his debut opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe in the 2010 blockbuster Inception.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The film received eight Oscar nominations and four wins, becoming among the top 25 highest-grossing movies of all time. His most famous part, though, was in the 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road. <a href=#>Hardy is among the most well-known British actors</a> worldwide, and both the industry and his followers respect and admire him. He owns an amazing collection of cars and understands how to use his money wisely. Let’s take a peek inside Tom Hardy’s insane car collection.</p><h2 id=audi-rs-5>Audi RS 5</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hardy genuinely enjoys driving Audis; in fact, Audi sponsors him. His car collection is filled with Audis, and his 2013 Audi RS 5 is the finest. The British actor was given the automobile by Audi UK in 2013, and he took it out for a test drive with the top down, despite the weather being against him. The RS 5 is powered by a 4.2-liter V8 engine that generates 450 horsepower as well as 317 pound-feet of torque. Through a seven-speed automatic dual-clutch manual transmission with shift paddles, power is transferred to all four wheels.</p><h2 id=audi-r8>Audi R8</h2><p>Tom Hardy acquired a black 2012 Audi R8 in 2012. It is one of <a href=#>the most elegant cars</a> with a matte metal touch that would attract everyone's attention. The all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi R8 4.2 is equipped with a 4.2-liter V8 engine positioned behind the rear seat that generates 430 horsepower and 317 pound-feet of torque. Standard on the R8 is a six-speed manual transmission with a locked metal shifter, and Audi boasts it can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=porsche-930-turbo>Porsche 930 Turbo</h2><p>Tom Hardy's purchase of the 930 Turbo Porsche 911 Turbo was unsurprising, given that he enjoys pushing the speed envelope to its absolute extent. The 930's interior features all the characteristics of a classic 911: tombstone seats, floor-hinged pedals, incomprehensible heater switches, and a steering wheel that conceals the gauges. This edition of Turbo is more stadium veteran than revolutionary upstart, and the most sensible supercar imaginable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Royal Fleet: A Peek Inside The Late Queen Elizabeth II's Luxury Car Collection</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cadillac-seville>Cadillac Seville</h2><p>Tom Hardy has a penchant for extending his <a href=#>insane car collection</a> with low-bodied automobiles, and the 1992 Cadillac Seville is another addition to that list. The vehicle is capable of merging onto a speedway or a highway with equal ease, and it is the epitome of the ideal balance between convenience and capability. It was named 1992 Car Of The Year. The Seville's 4.9-liter V8 engine generates 203 horsepower. The car underwent a number of adjustments and modifications for the 1992 model which resulted in the addition of new moldings and a colored grille.</p><h2 id=range-rover-sport>Range Rover Sport</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Hardy enjoys powerful cars, so it's hardly surprising that he has a 2018 Range Rover Sport. The 2006 model year vehicle blends off-road prowess with luxury features. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The design of the Sport edition</a>, which features either a one-speed or two-speed arrangement depending on the buyer's preference, saw a more subtle mid-cycle update. It has four engine configurations, including a 3.0-liter V6 with 340 horsepower as the base engine. The family-friendly vehicle with five seats is the ideal traveling companion for Hardy and his family.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Peek Inside Dua Lipa's Insane Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=mercedes-g-class>Mercedes G-Class</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mercedes G-Class is yet another vehicle that was able to find its way into Tom Hardy's incredible car collection. Hardy seemed to adore this incredible car, as he is frequently sighted riding it. The door handles of the 2018 model are updated in a way that is not significant but does feature the brand's characteristic look. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mercedes G-Class</a> is constructed with a 4.0-liter V8 engine that provides a power output of 416 horsepower and offers additional legroom in the rear passenger seats as a result of an increase in length of 2.1 inches.</p><h2 id=chevrolet-suburban>Chevrolet Suburban</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Hardy's Chevrolet Suburban is a dependable SUV that he has owned for a number of years. He uses it frequently for going on errands around town and for traveling to and from the airport. There are several engine options available for the Suburban, including a massive V8 with a top speed of 154 mph and acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour in just 7.4 seconds.</p><h2 id=bmw-i8>BMW I8</h2><p>The BMW i8, with its three-cylinder gas engine and electric motors, is one of <a href=#>the most luxurious cars</a>. The exterior design of the i8 was influenced by the Vision Efficient Dynamics concept exhibited at the 2009 Frankfurt Auto Show. It boasts a 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine that generates 357 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. The i8 can drive around 15 miles in EV mode and 330 miles on a full tank of gas and a fully charged battery, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The 8 Highest-Grossing Zendaya Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">21 Motoring</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Car Magazine</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Success Story</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8Bmp56dm2K2r7%2FInZxmrJ%2Bieqmt0Z2wrGWZo8CiusRmmpqqXZi8rbjEnKuip55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
