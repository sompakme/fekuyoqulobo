The promotion has quite a few names that got over with the crowd organically. However, not everyone got the success they hoped would come by becoming a fan favorite.</p><p>Between turning face and heel, the former seems like a difficult job to pull off because it’s often difficult to get a crowd full of people to like in an instant. For these five wrestlers, a babyface direction was the right direction to go.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-kris-statlander-ended-jade-cargill-s-historic-tbs-title-run>Kris Statlander ended Jade Cargill’s historic TBS title run</h2><p>Kris Statlander’s surprise return at AEW Double or Nothing 2023 got a huge pop from the crowd. The former Galaxy’s Greatest Alien pulled one of the biggest upsets in company history by toppling Jade Cargill for the TBS Championship.</p><p>Kris was already a fan favorite, but taking down Jade solidified her place on the babyface side. Statlander would carry Cargill to arguably the best match of her AEW career the next week on Rampage. It was a good move on Tony Khan’s part to pick Statlander as one to dethrone Cargill.</p><p>Along with Willow Nightingale, Statlander is arguably the purest babyface on the roster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Jon Moxley is referred to as the ‘heart & soul’ of AEW</h2><p>Jon Moxley started off in AEW as a sadistic heel. The former Dean Ambrose embarked on a heated feud with Kenny Omega that spanned across multiple pay-per-view events. Ironically, Omega’s heel turn would come at the expense of his bitter rival.</p><p>Moxley would gradually transition into a babyface on the road to capturing the AEW World Championship. He’d beat Chris Jericho to solidify himself as the company’s top superstar and a credible world champion.</p><p>He also happens to be the only man to win the title a record three times in AEW’s young history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Eddie Kingston is unequivocally admired by AEW fans</h2><p>Eddie Kingston is a top-tier promo. Kingston’s ability to evoke emotions through words is second to none. Every word he utters is so intense yet so admirable believable. Plus, his never-die attitude makes for a compelling babyface.</p><p>Kingston’s babyface turn came during the notorious exploding ring spot. While the spot may have undermined Kingston’s heroic efforts at the time, his commitment to his craft and to this business gets admired to this day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>The Acclaimed are among the most popular teams in AEW</h2><p>No tag team in the history of AEW has managed to capture fan emotion like The Acclaimed. Max Caster and Anthony Bowens started off as a pair of heels. They gradually got over with the fans to the point that Tony Khan had no option but to book them into winning the tag team titles.</p><p>Along with Billy Gunn, The Acclaimed are still among the most popular acts in AEW. Their tag team title win at Dynamite Grand Slam 2022 resulted in one of the loudest pops in company history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2>Wardlow’s face turn got the biggest pop at Revolution 2022</h2><p>Wardlow’s slow-burn hate for MFJ made for arguably the greatest face turn in AEW history. After months of being verbally abused by his employee, Wardlow finally turned face at Revolution 2022.</p><p>Mr. Mayhem would arrive to the ring during Max’s Dog Collar match with CM Punk. He’d hand Punk the Dynamite Diamond Ring to a thunderous reaction from the crowd. Punk would emerge victorious in the match.</p><p>As iconic as Wardlow’s face turn was, AEW failed to retain the big man’s momentum in the aftermath. The follow-up isn’t Wardlow’s fault as much as it is AEW creative, but that’s another argument. AEW tried to give him his moment back with a short TNT Championship run, but that failed to replicate the reception from Revolution 2022.</p><p>He’s once again back to being a hired muscle in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Adam Cole’s faction</a>.</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><ul><li>Jamie Hayter</li><li>Ricky Starks</li><li>Adam Cole</li><li>The Inner Circle</li><li>MJF</li></ul><p>: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Best Babyface Turns In WWE History</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZpudo6l6uL7ErKuloZ6cfHKAk2lwbWldanqjsdKtZJqdp2Kvoq7Yn5icnV2pwrO60g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
