They have become one of the biggest car manufacturers in the luxury and professional racing car world, and have always seemed to keep a step ahead of their competitors. Enzo Ferrari, who had a passion for cars that were luxurious, expensive and very fast, founded the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Enzo was fascinated with race-cars, driving and vehicle engineering, all throughout his life.&nbsp; He even had some experience in test driving cars at multiple car companies, throughout Italy. For instance, he worked for the car company Alfa Romeo, which was one of the paramount car companies of the time, and remains one of the biggest Italian car manufacturers today. Enzo worked with them for over two years. Following that, he did little more than supply tools and car pieces to suppliers. Eventually in 1943, Enzo built his own car called the Tip 815, but it was officially the first Ferrari ever built. He finally founded his own company four years later in 1947, and Ferrari has been making high quality and fast luxury cars ever since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, Ferrari is owned by Fiat, another Italian car company. Nonetheless, the glory days of Ferrari are far from over. Their cars have won several world tournaments and many car-racing champions continue to use Ferrari as their favored vehicle on the track.&nbsp; Ferrari isn't just a car company; it’s an icon. Their company has been built not with advertising and marketing techniques, but with the quality of their cars. With that being said, it does not come as a shock that&nbsp;all of Ferrari’s cars are expensive, but on this list, we will take a look at the ten most expensive vintage Ferraris:</p><h2 id=10-1975-ferrari-308-gtb><b>10. 1975 Ferrari 308 GTB</b></h2><p>via carspics-db.com</p><p>This is one of the cheapest vintage Ferraris of all time, but it’s still highly expensive when compared to other cars. The 308 GTB became world famous when it was Magnum’s (<a title="Tom Selleck Net Worth" href=#>Tom Selleck’s</a>) car of choice, in the hit 1980s show Magnum P.I.&nbsp;It might be the fact that this Ferrari was featured on TV that made it so expensive, with most fetching hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-1953-ferrari-375-america><b>9. 1953 Ferrari 375 America</b></h2><p>via:noticias.coches.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ferrari 375 America featured a Lampredi engine and had over 296 horsepower. But the real reason why the 375 is so expensive is because only eleven in history have been built, most of them in 1953, but a few in 1954. As a result, these can cost over a million dollars each.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-1966-ferrari-330-p3><b>8. 1966 Ferrari 330 P3</b></h2><p>via fr.wikipedia.org</p><p>The 330 P3 is unique because it was the very first Ferrari that had fiberglass doors, rather than the more traditional aluminum. Also unique about this car is the fact that the clutch to the manual transmission is behind the gearbox, rather than between the engine and gearbox. There’s also only one seat in the 330 P3, which is set near the center of the car.&nbsp; When sitting in it, you might actually feel that you’re lying down since the seat reclines so far back.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-1958-ferrari-412-s><b>7. 1958 Ferrari 412 S</b></h2><p>via dmarge.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Ferrari 412 S had a troubled history and it really is a miracle that they continued to be used. Additionally, it became one of the most expensive cars of the brand of all time. Debuting in 1958, the 412 S failed its first race and was promptly sent back to the Ferrari factory, putting the future of the car in doubt. Ferrari modified the car by adding disc brakes, and the car performed nearly flawlessly on the race track after that. It set a record of over one hundred and eighty miles per hour on the race track, in the 1960 Grand Prix in Los Angeles. It’s largely for that reason that the 412 S is so expensive today, but also among the most renowned cars in Ferrari’s history.</p><p></p><h2 id=6-1953-ferrari-340><b>6. 1953 Ferrari 340</b></h2><p>via:megadeluxe.com</p><p>Only three of the 1953 Ferrari 340 were built, making it among the rarest cars, not only of the Ferrari brand, but of all time. The car was first raced in 1953 as well, but at first, performed under expectations by failing to break the fifth place with each race. Ferrari enhanced the engine, giving the car over three hundred and seventy-five horsepower.&nbsp; After that, the 340 dominated the race tracks throughout Europe, and won multiple races before it was sold to someone in the United States. It continued to be raced for several years after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=5-1957-ferrari-625><b>5. 1957 Ferrari 625</b></h2><p>via pinterest.com</p><p>This Ferrari is very light, weighing less than a ton. Nonetheless, for such a little car, the 625 is capable of over three hundred and twenty horsepower, with a V12 engine. At the time, it was one of the fastest cars in the country, and was also renowned for its intricate and beautiful design. The 625 was sold at an auction in Monaco, in 2012, for over six million dollars, and only two of them were made, making it one of the rarest cars ever made.</p><p></p><h2 id=4-1959-ferrari-gt-250><b>4. 1959 Ferrari GT 250</b></h2><p>via bozhdynsky.com</p><p>Equipped with a V12 engine, the Ferrari GT 250 came in two versions, one designed for racing and the other for driving on the road. The company dedicated a lot of time and money throughout the 1950s to produce the GT 250, and it wasn't until almost the turn of the decade that it was released. The GT 250 quickly gained a stout reputation for being able to take sharp corners quickly and driving very fast on open roads.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=3-1961-ferrari-250-spyder><b>3. 1961 Ferrari 250 Spyder</b></h2><p>via wallpaperpics.net</p><p>The 1961 Ferrari 250 Spyder gained worldwide fame for appearing the 1980s hit movie, Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. But beyond the movie, the 250 Spyder is reputable for the fact that only fifty of them were built. They also came equipped with two seats, a drop top and a long hood. The car was equipped with a three liter V12 engine and had two hundred and eighty horsepower, with a standard four speed manual transmission. A few of these cars were sold at auction in 2008, and fetched almost thirteen million dollars each. British BBC radio 2 presenter,&nbsp;Chris Evans purchased a 250 Spyder from actor James Coburn. As of now, it appears that no others are up for sale. Ferrari is currently considering whether or not to make a replica 250 Spyder, but the company’s decision has yet to be announced.</p><p></p><h2 id=2-1957-ferrari-250-testa-rossa><b>2. 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa</b></h2><p>via:www.motorauthority.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa recently sold at auction for $16 million, in late August of 2011. The 250 Testa Rossa was raced at Le Mans in 1958, and won many races and awards. Ferrari worked to restore many of the 250 Testa Rossa’s that were still in good condition (including the color of the car), making many of them in 'like new' condition and more than likely contributing to the sixteen million dollar price tag. The 250 Testa Rossa that sold at auction in 2011, appeared just as it did, all the way back in 1957.</p><p></p><h2 id=1-1962-ferrari-250-gto><b>1. 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO</b></h2><p>via en.wikipedia.org</p><p>Only 39 1962 Ferrari GTO’s have ever been made, and were built for Sir Stirling Moss, a British racing legend. Unfortunately, Stirling was never able to race the 1962 250 GTO, as he was injured in a car accident that effectively ended his racing career. The 250 GTO went on to win many races at Le Mans and other races, throughout the 1960s. The car is capable of traveling from zero to sixty miles per hour, in just under six seconds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e5BpZKieXam1pnnRmqmeq6Rirq%2BwjKamrKxdmsWxsc2soK%2BdXau2r8DAoJxmnpWnv6K%2ByKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
