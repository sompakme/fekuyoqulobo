"She trusts him and knows he's got no other agenda but to be a good friend."</p><p>The Presley family has gone through a number of high-profile losses and controversies in recent years. For example, the release of several big movies regarding Elvis' life (including Sofia Coppola's Priscilla) has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caused the public to question his reputation</a>, particularly the revelation that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began a relationship with Priscilla when she was a teen</a>, despite their 14-year age difference, which critics have deemed inappropriate and creepy.</p><p>But the negative reaction to recent movies about Elvis may be the least of the Presley family's concerns, given the two significant deaths that struck the clan. In July 2020, Priscilla’s grandson, Benjamin Keogh, died by suicide after a years-long battle with depression. He was the only son of Priscilla’s daughter Lisa Marie Presley, who died in January 2023 after complaining of abdominal pain.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She was taken to hospital but later died of cardiac arrest, though a cause of death later revealed her passing was the result of bowel obstruction complications from a weight loss surgery she’d undergone years prior.</p><h2 id=priscilla-just-settled-a-lawsuit-she-filed-against-her-daughter>Priscilla Just Settled A Lawsuit She Filed Against Her Daughter</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lisa-marie-presley-riley-keough-harper-finley-lockwood.jpg><p>As the only daughter of Elvis, Lisa Marie left behind a large fortune plus stake in her father’s estate (which continues to make money and is worth approximately $100 million), which led to a dispute between her eldest daughter, Riley Keough, and mother, Priscilla, who contested the latest version of Lisa Marie’s will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Riley (who has two minor sisters who will eventually get stakes in Elvis’ estate when they come of age) eventually reached an agreement with her grandmother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which gave her control of the estate</a> and was signed off by the court this past August.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/why-did-elvis-presley-never-perform-_if-i-can-dream_-live-despite-being-a-hit-among-fans_-dront-deposit-back-elvis-presley_youtube-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='Why Did Elvis Presley Never Perform "If I Can Dream" Live Despite Being A Hit Among Fans?'>Why Did Elvis Presley Never Perform "If I Can Dream" Live Despite Being A Hit Among Fans?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Music legend Elvis Presley refused to perform one of his most acclaimed songs live, here's why.</p><p>The agreement stipulates that Riley would pay Priscilla $1 million plus an additional $400,000 to go towards her legal bills.
