Or maybe one in Ios, Greece? Or maybe London?&nbsp; Well, your best bet is to find an organized crawl. They come in all shapes and sizes. They come cheap and cheerful or cheerful and not-so-cheap.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Top 10 European Party Cities You Need To Visit</a></span></p><p>The pub crawls on this list run from the one-off afternoon or evening crawls to an 11-day extravaganza of crawling and beer fests. We have partying pub crawls, musical pub crawls, even a literary one. Here are 10 of Europe's best pub crawls. Whether you're young or not-so-young, there's something here for you.</p><h2 id=prague-pub-crawl>Prague Pub Crawl</h2><p>Party city Prague! For around $27, this four-hour evening walking crawl promises you the night of your life. You get an experienced local guide. Plus, you get unlimited free drinks at your first stop.</p><p>Don't roll up in January and expect to join the tour. It's a spring and summer thing. But they do a totally mega New Years' Eve Crawl. It's $110. Of course, there's a free bottle of champagne thrown in.&nbsp; New Years' Eve will be great. Who knows how you will feel on New Years' Day. Age group: Young (at least 18).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dublin-literary-pub-crawl>Dublin Literary Pub Crawl</h2><p>What do you call a Dublin pub crawl of traditional pubs, once frequented by great Irish writers? Fun, interesting, hilarious? Yes to all three. It begins with you sipping a pint at the Duke Pub while listening to the actors reenacting the hilarious antics of writers such as Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, and George Barnard Shaw, all famous imbibers. There's even a literary quiz with prizes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Reasons You Must Visit Ireland In Your Lifetime</a></span></p><p>For around $17, it sounds like a good deal. But don't forget, you pay for all your food and drink. And since the actors are probably "resting" (out of work), don't forget the gratuities. Age group: Mixed.</p><h2 id=ios-one-and-only-bar-crawl>Ios (One And Only) Bar Crawl</h2><p>Ios is one of the Greek Islands. It's an "any excuse for a party"&nbsp; kind of place in the Mediterranean Sea, a mecca for young holidaymakers who are looking for sun, sand, and nightlife. From June through September the Ios Pub Crawl takes vacationers on what they call the night of your life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For just over $30, you get six stops, a free drink or two, a free singlet, discounts, and a local guide. Oh, it doesn't start until midnight, so don't make complicated plans for the next day. You may well be hiding behind your sunglasses on a lounger. Age group: Young</p><h2 id=historical-pub-walking-tour-of-london>Historical Pub Walking Tour Of London</h2><p>This half-day crawl takes you to the City, the oldest part of London. Think St. Paul's Cathedral and an old Shakespearian playhouse. You'll visit around five pubs, including Blackfriars, one of London's oldest pubs. Then there's the 17th-century boozer once frequented by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Bars In London</a></span></p><p>For $117,&nbsp; you get a guide but no drinks. When they say "historical", they mean it. You will learn a lot of history in between pub stops. The crawl ends up at Covent Garden, with its open-air dining, cool pubs, and quirky one-off shops. You're on your own after that. But the guide will give you some insider tips for where to go. Age group: Mixed.</p><h2 id=dublin-traditional-irish-music-pub-crawl>Dublin Traditional Irish Music Pub Crawl</h2><p>You'll meet your two guides at Temple Bar.&nbsp;The very good news is that Temple Bar has one of the largest collections of whiskey collections in Ireland, everything from Scotch to Bourbon. At last count, some 450 bottles of the stuff.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is an evening tour with a difference because your guides are musicians. You crawl, eating and drinking at your own expense while listening to music. It's only $18. So, a real bargain. As an added bonus, you get reserved seating at some of Dublin's most crowded alehouses. Age group: Mixed.</p><h2 id=berlin-anti-pub-crawl>Berlin Anti-Pub Crawl</h2><p>For the younger crowd, pub crawls are often rolling, massive parties. Think huge groups and party hard. Berlin's night time Anti-Pub Crawl is a crawl for the young. But, instead of a huge group and "party like there's no tomorrow" vibe, it offers both smaller groups and, yes, party. But forget the hard bit. At around $16, it's good value for money.</p><p>Because they go for Berlin's underground scene, you'll actually be able to hear yourself think. Plus, you'll actually probably meet some real live locals. And, depending on everyone's language skills, you can carry on a conversation. Age Group: Young</p><h2 id=budapest-ruin-bar-tour>Budapest Ruin Bar Tour</h2><p>Ruin bar?&nbsp; Budapest's ruin bars are sometimes in open courtyards and sometimes in, yes, ruins. Trust us, after World War II, there were a lot of ruins in Budapest. This three-hour evening crawl markets itself to all age groups (18-100). And it is centered on the totally cool Jewish Quarter, the center of Budapest's legendary, quirky nightlife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Top 10 Must-See Budapest Tourist Attractions</a></span></p><p>Even better, there's a welcome drink thrown in at each bar. It comes in at around $17. And, like the Anti-Pub Crawl, the bars and clubs are not party hard places. You'll actually be able to carry on a conversation without competing with booming music. Age group: Mixed.</p><h2 id=belgian-beer-tasting-in-brussels>Belgian Beer Tasting In Brussels</h2><p>This is a pub crawl and a rolling classroom because your guide explains how Belgian beer is made and what is unique about its taste and flavors. Will it make you a connoisseur? No way. But you should come away from this 2 to 3-hour evening tour a little tipsy and savvier about those <a href=#>strong</a> Belgian beers.</p><p>They throw in one Belgian Trappist ale and, at the end, a 3-beer tasting selection. And&nbsp;coming in at around $16, it won't break the bank. It looks like a female kind of thing.</p><h2 id=london-pubs---private-black-taxi-tour>London Pubs - Private Black Taxi Tour</h2><p>Yes, it's expensive. But just imagine sitting in the back of a Black Taxi and being talked at by a London cabbie. He'll explain this and that about what you are seeing, probably tell you about all the famous people he's had in his cab, and (best of all), he will drop you at no fewer than three historical pubs to sample whatever you like. The 4-hour tour is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> child-friendly</a>, which means you will be visiting pubs that welcome children. How much you ask. A mere $401. Don't forget the gratuity. Afterward, have high tea and discuss the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beer-or-bust>Beer Or Bust</h2><p>This has got to be the granddaddy of all pub crawls. And the most <a href=#>bizarre</a>. It's 11 days of beer festivals and pub crawls across Germany and the Czech Republic. You hit Munich's Oktoberfest and Stuttgart's Beer Festival. And in between, you pub crawl around Prague's more traditional alehouses. After that, it's crawling around picturesque Rothenburg, Germany, including Zur Hoell, a watering hole that first opened its doors in 900 A.D.</p><p>And they promise "no boring sightseeing". The 2020 tour (September 29 - October 9) has fewer than seven places left. The price? A mere $2,753. No, airfare is not included. Can't afford it? Put it on your bucket list and start saving up.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Top 10 Bucket List Items</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7Kte8SuqaiolWK9tq6MnKmar5yoeqetzZywZpqVqMFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
