A new season is currently on A&E, with the favorites making a return, the like of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandi Passante</a> is back, and to make things a little awkward, so is Jarrod Schulz. We'll clarify that situation a little later in the article. As for Brandi and her success on the show, she admits, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it isn't as easy as it appears on television,</a> "You're going to get good ones and bad ones, and I don't think the show really highlights the bad ones as much ... but it definitely happens," Brandi said. "From the very beginning, I think when people saw the show, they just assumed that this was some kind of get-rich-quick, modern-day treasure hunt and in every unit, you're going to find something great — but that's just not how it goes. You just have to try your best to make a guesstimate as to what's going to be in there."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Real Reason Barry Weiss Left Storage Wars</a></span></p><p>She's back on the show searching for new treasures but this time around, things are a lot different for Brandi, especially when it comes to her life outside of the show.</p><h2 id=quietly-splitting-up>Quietly Splitting Up</h2><p>Perhaps the most surprising part of Brandi's life nowadays is the fact that she's no longer alongside Jarrod Schulz. In fact, the two called a day two years ago, mutually parting ways. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brandi considers herself as a single mom these days</a>, according to her words with People, "I did a lot of it on my own anyway, but it's the scary dad voice in the background that we're missing. I have them all the time, 24/7 they're here with me, so I have to navigate that."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Storage Wars: 20 Junky Items That Turned Out To Be Worth A Fortune</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the breakup, both seem to be okay with attending an auction, just not with each other. For Brandi, this is a big part of her life, trying to find herself, without any partner at the moment, "I wasn't really allowed to have an identity for many, many years. And so these last couple of years, I'm kind of coming into my own and figuring out who I am," she said. "I just don't have an attachment to anyone. I've definitely dated and things like that, but ... right now it's not something I'm really trying hard to seek out. I'm waiting until I can feel an attachment to someone."</p><p>Given the content on Brandi's Instagram account, she's definitely having a good time alongside her gal pals, as they take on some fun adventures together. It seems like these days, her biggest priorities are Storage Wars, taking care of her two kids, and having some fun along the way, something she wasn't accustomed to the past couple of years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Rules The Cast Of Storage Wars Follows When They Bid On A Car</a></span></p><p>Sources: IG, People & Distractify</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKysn6euqLGMsJirq12owaK%2BjJupmqaUnnqxrdKsmKeslWK2tHnUqWStp12jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
