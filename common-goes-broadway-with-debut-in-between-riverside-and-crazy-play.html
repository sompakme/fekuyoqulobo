Performances begin on Nov. 30 at Second Stage’s Hayes Theater with the official opening night set for Dec. 19.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Austin Pendleton-directed play tells the story of ex-cop and recent widower Walter “Pops” Washington (Stephen McKinley Henderson) and his recently paroled son Junior (Common). The two face challenges as they try to hold on to one of the last great rent stabilized apartments on Riverside Drive. As City Hall begins making demands, the landlord wants the father-son duo out of the building. The play examines “old wounds, sketchy new houseguests and a final ultimatum…” According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, the 2015 staging included Ron Cephas-Jones in the role of Junior.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">An elated Common took to his Instagram account to share what this moment means for him. “This has been a dream of mine for a very long time to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234668747>act in a play</a>, to do theater, and to be a part of a theatre company,” he captioned his announcement. “I am supremely grateful and overwhelmingly inspired to be apart of ‘Between Riverside and Crazy.’ I can’t wait to begin this process and to live this journey.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “You never could have told me that little south side boy that he would be on Broadway. When I got this role, I called my mother like I had gotten my first record contract. Haha! It was that much joy. I have been told how hard the work is in that there’s nothing like it. This is what I want as an artist and as a being that believes art can heal and inspire.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The almost <a href=#>EGOT-status</a> artist also shared that he’d like to use his Broadway debut to “express that light and love” to others. “I thank GOD for the opening of doors in this blessing,” he said. “So pls come back check out our play y’all. Thank you @2stnyc for the opportunity! Woooooooooo. Love”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although new to Broadway, Common is no stranger to acting. He recently starred alongside Keke Palmer in the 2022 film&nbsp;Alice, as well Stefon Bristol’s&nbsp;Breathe&nbsp;with Jennifer Hudson, Milla Jovovich and Quvenzhané Wallis. His other forthcoming projects are Apple TV+’s sci-fi drama series&nbsp;Wool&nbsp;and the independent Hollywood satire&nbsp;El Tonto. The 50-year-old has also showcased his acting skills in&nbsp;Never Have I Ever, The Informer&nbsp;and&nbsp;Suicide Squad and more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Common deservingly took home a 2015 Oscar and 2016 Grammy for his song “Glory,” co-written with John Legend for the film&nbsp;Selma. He also <a href=# data-type=post data-id=537251>scored an Emmy</a> for the song “Letter To The Free” in the 2017 documentary&nbsp;13th. His upcoming Broadway debut could open him up to EGOT status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5i8rrnOp2SbnaSssqa6jKugr52iqLalsYyapZ1lk6euu8WMm6momZSsrrp5z6WYsmVhZ4B1gphtaHJuXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
