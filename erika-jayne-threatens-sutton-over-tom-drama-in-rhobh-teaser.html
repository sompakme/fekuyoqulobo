Get old and go broke,” Erika, 50, says in the teaser after the women celebrate the Chinese New Year with a big dinner.</p><p>While <a href=#><strong>Garcelle Beauvais</strong></a> appears to be taking Erika at her word that she had no part in Tom’s legal drama — the estranged spouses made headlines in December 2020 when they were named in a case against law firm Girardi & Keese <a href=#>regarding money that was intended for the families of victims killed in a 2018 plane crash</a> — she’s one of the few siding with the Bravo star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RHOBHs-Erika-Denies-Suttons-Claims-That-Shes-Lying-About-Toms-Legal-Woes.jpg><p>“I’m not going to s–t on her when she’s at her bottom. That’s not who I am,” Garcelle, 54, tells <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a> at one point in the clip.</p><p>Garcelle later tells the group at a dinner that “If what Tom did was true, then f–k Tom.” Erika is in agreement with Garcelle, adding, “If he stole the money, I’d like to know where it is?”</p><p>However, it becomes clear in the trailer that <a href=#><strong>Sutton Stracke</strong></a> is not convinced that <a href=#>Erika is telling the ladies the whole truth</a>.</p><p>“Have we been duped by the lies?” she asks some of the Housewives while they sit in their pajamas on a girls’ getaway.</p><p>Erika is <a href=#>not pleased with Sutton’s comments</a> and threatens her during one of the squad’s fancy meals. “You ever call me a liar again, I’m coming for you,” she tells Sutton, 49, who later breaks down while shopping with <a href=#><strong>Kyle Richards</strong></a>.</p><p>“I don’t care if they’re empty threats!” Sutton says while holding back tears.</p><p>During a separate beachside celebration, Erika appears to attack Dorit, 45, as well, for seemingly questioning her involvement in the scandal.</p><p>“Guess what bitch? I’m not threatening, I’m promising,” Erika says at one point as Dorit sits across from her on the sand.</p><p>The teaser ends with Erika breaking down at the dinner table, telling Dorit, “Look at me. Look at my f–king life!”</p><p>Earlier this season, fans watched as Erika, <a href=#>who filed for divorce in November 2020</a>, <a href=#>denied that she knew anything</a> about Tom, 82, allegedly stealing settlement funds.</p><p>“I kept asking. And I was continuously shut out. I [pleaded], I begged, I tried. I pushed as hard as I could until I couldn’t push anymore,” the Broadway star said during the July 14, episode of RHOBH, claiming she was innocent.</p><p>Erika and Tom’s legal battle is still ongoing, long after cameras stopped rolling on season 11 of the Bravo series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Earlier this month, a judge ruled that Tom’s former clients <strong>Joe Ruigomez</strong>, <strong>Jaime Ruigomez</strong> and <strong>Kathy Ruigomez</strong> <a href=#>can pursue a collections lawsuit against his estranged wife</a>, according to court documents obtained by Us. They will be able to collect the $11 million they are due from Tom, which was determined in litigation in 2020.</p><p>While Erika has not been charged with any crimes, <a href=#>a judge ordered her to turn over her financial records</a> by July 21 amid Tom’s lawsuits and the investigation into the pair’s assets. Tom, for his part, has been placed under conservatorship after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyroZuWequt2KecZqyYp7KiwMSnqmarpanBsLqMqK2eql2pvK55w6uYppldnrtuvseomaFlpJqutLHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
