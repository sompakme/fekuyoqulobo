On the morning of September 11th, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@MGMResortsIntl published the first of several tweets</a> disclosing the issue, explaining:</p><p>"MGM Resorts recently identified a cybersecurity issue affecting some of the Company's systems. Promptly after detecting the issue, we quickly began an investigation with assistance from leading external cybersecurity experts. We also notified law enforcement and took prompt action to protect our systems and data, including shutting down certain systems ... Our investigation is ongoing, and we are working diligently to determine the nature and scope of the matter."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On September 12th, financial news outlet CNBC <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">covered the attack</a>, reporting that "nearly every aspect" of MGM's operations were disrupted in the course of the incident. Reservations, key cards, and "casino floors" were affected, and the company was forced to disable its email system.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Casino Cruises In The World, Ranked</a></span></p><p>CNBC also detailed MGM Resorts' then-recent quarterly revenue from the period prior to the cyberattack, noting that bookings remained more lucrative than "casino operations":</p><p>"Revenue from their hotel rooms in Las Vegas outstrips the revenue directly attributed to their casino operations, according to SEC filings. The company reported Las Vegas rooms revenue of $706.7 million for the quarter ended June 30 [2023], compared to casino revenue of $492.2 million for the same period."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an article updated on September 13th, technology news site The Verge published information about an unsubstantiated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claim of responsibility for the attack</a>:</p><p>"A ransomware group named ALPHV / BlackCat claimed responsibility, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter, from malware tracker vx-underground (via Engadget), saying they received the information directly. The unverified post alleges that the group used a social engineering attack, calling the company’s help desk with an MGM Resorts employee’s information they found on LinkedIn."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Nightclubs And Bars In Las Vegas, Ranked</a></span></p><p>The Verge added that MGM Resorts temporarily updated their website to notify guests about the attack, and to apologize for the inconvenience.

The outlet quoted an expert's estimate of $80 million in damages – and provided context for that figure against MGM's broader revenues:</p><p>"Gregory Moody, professor and director of the cybersecurity program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, pointed to quoted estimates that the computer shutdown cost the company up to $8 million per day, which could put the cumulative effect at $80 million. But Moody also noted that MGM Resorts reports annual revenues above $14 billion, which would mean it averages at least $270 million in revenues per week."</p><p>MGM Resorts was the only casino hit by a cyberattack in September. "Rival casino" company <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caesars Entertainment told federal investigators</a> it had been "hit with a cyberattack" on September 7th, but claimed its operations were not affected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>The Most Expensive Restaurants In Las Vegas, As Of 2023</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpp%2BdYrC6rsSrmK2skZi4cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
