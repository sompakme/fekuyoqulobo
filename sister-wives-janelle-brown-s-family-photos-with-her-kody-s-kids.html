The couple share&nbsp;sons Logan (born in 1994),&nbsp;Hunter (born in 1997), Robert Garrison (born in 1998) and&nbsp;Gabriel “Gabe” (born in 2001), along with&nbsp;daughters Madison “Maddie” (born in 1995) and Savanah (born in 2004).</p><p class=p1>The Wyoming native also entered into a spiritual marriage with <a href=#><strong>Christine Brown</strong></a> in 1994&nbsp;before they <a href=#>announced their&nbsp;split in November 2021</a>.

You have strengths, and you have blessings and you have opportunities that you’re given … you can’t compare. I just think comparison is, like, the death of plural marriage.”</p><p>Though Janelle revealed in December 2022 that she and Kody had been <a href=#>separated for several months</a>, the two have remained proud supporters of their six kids.</p><p class=p1>“Maddie and I had an event with Plexus this weekend in Phoenix.
