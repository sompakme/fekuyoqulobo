Steve Stanulis, who was once Kanye West‘s bodyguard, opened up about his experience working with the rapper — and didn’t hold back on any of the “ridiculous rules” he followed.
“He wanted you to stay 10 paces behind him on a city street,” Stanulis claimed during a recent episode of the “Hollywood Raw” podcast. “So obviously, if someone is going to come up and do something, by the time I run up and try to prevent it, it would have already happened."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While discussing <a href=#>some of the more bizarre antics</a> he’d been present for, Stanulis recalled his first time meeting the Yeezy designer during a past fashion week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kanye-West-Former-Bodyguard-Drags-the-Rapper-Ridiculous-Rules.jpg><p>“I was supposed to meet him at the studio. When he gets there, we get into the elevator and he’s like, ‘Aren’t you going to push what floor we’re going to?'” the retired cop claimed. “I said, ‘I have no idea, it’s my first day.’ So he starts ranting: ‘So you mean you didn’t call ahead to find out where I’m supposed to be going?’ I said no, so he’s <a href=#>ranting and raving</a>.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Not putting up with the drama, Stanulis gave the Grammy winner three options. “One, you could tell me what button to press, and now I’ll know. Two, you could press the button, and I’ll see which one you press and then I’ll know,” he recalled. “Or three, you can sit in here all day and <a href=#>tell me how important your time is</a> and we are not going to go anywhere. And again, that was our first interaction.”</p><p>The former security professional previously worked alongside <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Alanis Morissette</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Woody Harrelson</strong></a> and<a href=#> <strong>Tobey Maguire</strong></a>, but West was one of the only stars he protected who he remembers having tense conversations with while trying to do his job. “It happened numerous times,” he alleged on the podcast. “I gave him the one, two, threes.”</p><p>Throughout his rise to fame, the “Stronger” rapper has become known for being <a href=#>eccentric</a> and causing controversy, from <a href=#>putting former President <strong>George W. Bush</strong> on blast</a> for “not caring about black people” to more recently claiming that <a href=#>slavery was “a choice.”</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmZ6usm7DxKyrrGWWpL%2BusdFmmaicqZzCor7DZpurmZeoerW0xGapmqigmr%2B0edGim6KbpaG8tr%2BMq6ylnaNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
