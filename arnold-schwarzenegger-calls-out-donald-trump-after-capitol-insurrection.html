But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol. They shattered the ideas we took for granted," he added. "They did not just break down the doors of the building that housed American democracy. They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger, who was born two years after World War II, said he witnessed "broken men drinking away the guilt over their participation in the most evil regime in history" that "started with lies, and lies, and lies, and intolerance." He added that although he didn’t believe the US was on the same path, “we must be aware of the dire consequences of selfishness and cynicism."</p><p>The Terminator star believes Trump, who he branded as “a failed leader,” will be remembered as “the worst president ever,” after attempting to “to overturn the results of an election and of a fair election” by encouraging a coup. He went on to hold those who "enabled [Trump's] lies and his treachery" complicit in last week’s events.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Schwarzenegger noted that “we need to look past ourselves, our parties, and disagreements, and put our democracy first," warning those who think they can overturn the Constitution that they will never win. He also wished <a href=#>President-elect Biden</a> well, saying, “If you succeed, our nation succeeds. We support you with all our hearts as you seek to bring us together.'"</p><p>Source: <a href=#>ETOnline</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Trump Temporarily Blocked On Twitter, Facebook After Capitol Hill Attack" href=#>Trump Temporarily Blocked On Twitter, Facebook After Capitol Hill Attack</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8CrpaiklGLApLTWmqmznZ6atKix0WaamqScqHqwwdNmm6imkaGxbsDRrqSpZZGbwaa%2BjJyYqaGkpLlutc2srKuqlZjBqrvNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
