They're obsessed with the way she was able to handle herself and the way she ultimately opted to say "I choose myself" when facing a moment of truth on her wedding day. There's been a huge movement online, with fans suggesting she would be a smash hit in the role of the Bachelorette.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is 'Love Is Blind Brazil' Good?

She immediately stood out among the rest on the show and her storyline took the world by storm. She was able to open up to Shake with genuine sincerity, and she demonstrated that she has a soft side that is incredibly easy to love. She also showed her fans that she was a strong woman who wouldn't settle for anything less than she deserves and fans took an immediate liking to her courageous side, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-deepti-make-an-impact-on-39-the-bachelorette-39><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Can Deepti Make An Impact On 'The Bachelorette'?</span></h2><p>In a moment that was perfectly suited for reality television, Deepti did the unthinkable and stormed away from her groom, leaving him stunned, and alone at the mandap. She had spent so much time getting ready for this very moment in every way, but, realizing that her heart wasn't really in it, Deepti demonstrated tenacity and courage by abandoning the entire wedding and choosing a different path for her future. Fans know Deepti has the confidence to be a true leader and a pillar of strength on <strong><a href=#>The Bachelorette,</a></strong> and they're hoping she can take on the new leading role.</p><h2 id=will-deepti-join-39-the-bachelorette-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Will Deepti Join 'The Bachelorette'?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans are all-in on the idea of having Deepti star as the new Bachelorette, but the likelihood of that actually happening is slim to none. <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>and ABC are completely different networks, and the cross-over between networks isn't a common concept. The producers would certainly get a beautiful, self-assured Bachelorette if they'd give Deepti a chance, but at this point, this idea seems to be wishful thinking.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How 'Love Is Blind' Season 2 Changed Their Casting Approach</a></span></p><h2 id=deepti-vempati-39-s-career><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Deepti Vempati's Career</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So who is this lovely lady that everyone is mesmerized with, anyway?
