She also thinks it’s important for Jace to be around a father figure to learn ‘boy things’ and have ‘men talk.’ She has seen the way David parents my children and she knows we’re able to handle it.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>Despite that and other moments of apparent reconciliation over the years, </span><span>Barbara and Jenelle seem to always end up fighting again.</span><span> Keep scrolling to see their biggest ups and downs:</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwaaxzWakqKVdZ3qiuNSmZKOdnpq5rbGMnq2apqNiurC5jJuYq5qRp660edSpqmaZnpl6pbvWp6po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
