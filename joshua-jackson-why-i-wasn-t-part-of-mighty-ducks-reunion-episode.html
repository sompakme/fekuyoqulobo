He’s probably somehow peripherally involved in the Minnesota Wilds organization,” the former Dawson’s Creek star said. “Maybe [he] settled down in Minneapolis-Saint Paul, got a couple of little kids of his own, hopefully. I think Charlie did alright.”</p><p>In February, Game Changers executive producer <strong>Steven Brill</strong> told Us Weekly and other reporters that they had spoken to Jackson multiple times over the years about possibly being part of the series, which followed a new group of hockey players and Coach Bombay (<a href=#><strong>Emilio Estevez</strong></a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Joshua-Jackson-Reveals-Why-He-Wasnt-Part-of-Mighty-Ducks-Reunion-Episode-3.jpg><p>“He’s <a href=#>part of the family</a> and part of the group with everyone else,” the producer said. “When and where they show up is an open, exciting question.”</p><p>During the first season, original stars <strong>Elden Henson</strong>, <strong>Marguerite Moreau</strong>, <strong>Matt Doherty</strong>, <strong>Garrett Henson</strong>, <strong>Vincent LaRusso</strong> and <strong>Justin Wong</strong> <a href=#>appeared on one episode</a>.

COVID made it hard,” Brill told <a href=#>Entertainment Weekly</a> at the time. “He actually just had a baby right in the middle of this and the idea of him coming up wasn’t practical or possible.
