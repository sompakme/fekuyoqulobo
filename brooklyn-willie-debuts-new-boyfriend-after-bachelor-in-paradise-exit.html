It really put me out of my comfort zone, and I feel like that’s kind of when the best things happen,” she said during an episode of the <a href=# rel=noopener>“Bachelor Happy Hour”</a> podcast. “So, you know, when I had the opportunity to go back in[to] an environment where it’s not normal and you’re not comfortable. I just wanted to jump into that opportunity because, like I said, when I had those opportunities — to be out of my comfort zone — that’s when the best things happened. So I wanted to put it all out there again.”</p><p class=p1>Willie was one of four women — along with <a href=#><strong>Greer Blitzer</strong></a>, <strong>Cat Wong</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Olivia Lewis</strong></a> — hoping to get <strong>Peter Cappio</strong>’s rose during the October 4 episode.
